# GenMotion templates

A template is an ordinary GenMotion project — `project.json`, `scenes/`,
`components/`, `assets/` — plus a `template.json` sidecar, living at
`packages/templates/catalog/<id>/`. Nothing about the project format changes;
`template.json` is what makes a folder show up in the gallery.

Three things get generated from that folder and must stay in sync with it:
`poster.jpg` (a still frame), `video.mp4` (the whole thing, rendered — lives in
R2, not git), and the wire summary the API serves. This skill covers producing
all three, plus the checklist for adding a template in the first place.

## Adding a new template from an existing project

1. **Find the source project.** User projects live at
   `~/.genmotion/projects/<slug>/`. Match by the project's `name` field in
   `project.json`, not the folder slug (grep every `project.json`'s `name` — the
   folder name is often a generated prompt-slug that doesn't match what the user
   calls it). If more than one candidate matches, prefer the most recently
   modified.

2. **Find what's actually referenced**, not everything in `assets/`. Diff two
   things against the folder's real asset list:
   - `grep -rhoE 'assets/[A-Za-z0-9._ -]+\.(png|jpg|jpeg|webp|svg|mp4|mp3|gif)' scenes components`
     — every asset a scene or component actually imports.
   - `project.json`'s `audio[].file` and each `scenes[].audio` — manifest-declared
     audio, which isn't imported, just referenced by path.

   Everything else in the source `assets/` folder is orphaned (old pasted
   screenshots, unused alternate takes) — leave it behind. Copy `project.json`,
   `scenes/*`, `components/*`, and only the referenced assets into
   `packages/templates/catalog/<id>/assets/`.

3. **Curate assets under budget.** One hard limit, enforced by a test:
   **12MB total** (`MAX_REMIX_BYTES`) — the whole remix bundle. There's also a
   soft one worth respecting even though nothing enforces it: **512KB per
   image** (`TEMPLATE_INLINE_LIMIT`) is where an image stops inlining as a data
   URL into the compiled scene — over that, it becomes a `TRIPWIRE_PREFIX`
   placeholder instead. This used to be a hard requirement (an unresolved
   placeholder broke the render), but it isn't anymore — see "On-screen video
   and oversized images" below. Compress anyway where it's easy: it's what
   keeps a remix download small and the catalog light.

   Compress with `sips` (zero-dependency, already on macOS):
   ```sh
   # Resize an oversized background/wallpaper to something sane for a 1080p/1920p canvas
   sips -Z 1920 -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 78 image.jpg --out image.jpg
   # Convert a PNG screenshot to JPEG (screenshots are rarely transparent in practice)
   sips -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 82 shot.png --out shot.jpg
   ```
   Converting `.png` → `.jpg` changes the filename — grep the scene/component
   files that `import` it and update those import paths too. Verify with
   `file assets/*.jpg` that nothing is secretly still PNG-encoded bytes wearing
   a `.jpg` extension.

4. **Write `template.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "kebab-case-id-matching-the-folder-name",
     "title": "Notion launch video",
     "description": "One sentence for the gallery card AND the page's meta description — make it read well as both.",
     "metaTitle": "Notion Productivity App Launch Video Template — GenMotion",
     "category": "product | social | intro | explainer | data",
     "tags": ["Two", "To three", "from TEMPLATE_TAGS"],
     "publishedAt": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "featured": false,
     "order": 100
   }
   ```
   - `title`: sentence case, and it says what the video *is* — "Notion launch
     video", "WhatsApp chat video" — not just the brand ("Notion Launch"). It
     is the card, the `<h1>`, the remix's project name, and the phrase the
     page's FAQ questions are built around, so it has to read as a noun phrase
     mid-sentence ("How do I make a Notion launch video?").
   - `metaTitle` is the `<title>` the web page renders: the brand plus the
     search keyword the plain `title` lacks, in Title Case, ≤ 60 characters
     ("Prequel Screen Recorder Launch Video Template — GenMotion"). Always
     suffix `— GenMotion`. Omit the field entirely to fall back to `"<title>
     Template — GenMotion"` if nothing more specific is warranted.
   - `tags`: 2–3 from the closed set in `packages/templates/src/schema.ts`
     (`TEMPLATE_TAGS`: Social Media, Launch Video, Announcement, Promotional,
     Educational, Tutorial). **Every 9:16 (portrait) template must include
     "Social Media"** — a catalog test enforces this. Don't force a tag that
     doesn't honestly fit; an empty category is fine.
   - `publishedAt`: today, `YYYY-MM-DD`. The gallery sorts newest-first on
     this, so it is what puts a new template on the first page.
   - `featured`: whether the marketing home page's strip may show it. Defaults
     to false, and that is the honest default for a new template — the home
     page is a curated selection, not the catalog. The full `/templates`
     gallery, the desktop app and the sitemap list every template either way,
     so leaving it off costs a template nothing but the front page. Ask before
     flipping it on; it is an editorial call, not a mechanical step.
   - `order`: one past the current highest (`grep -rh '"order"' packages/templates/catalog/*/template.json`).
     Only breaks ties between templates published the same day.
   - `sampleAt` (optional, 0–1): fraction into the first scene where the poster
     samples its frame. Only set this if the default (0.6) lands mid-transition
     — check after generating the poster (step 6), don't guess ahead of time.
   - Don't write a `video` field yourself — `render-video.mjs` stamps it
     automatically (step 7) with the R2 URL its last upload landed at. It's a
     record for a human to glance at, not something any client reads; hand
     editing it does nothing but lie in the sidecar until the next render.

5. **Regenerate the scaffold** (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.npmrc`,
   `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md` — written fresh from `@genmotion/project`'s own
   renderers, not copied from the source project; `README.md` is step 6 and is
   hand-written):
   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @genmotion/templates scaffold <id>
   ```

6. **Write `README.md`** (the scaffold does not write this one, and a catalog
   test fails without it). It travels with a remix and overrides the
   scaffold's generic README, so it is the page someone lands on when the user
   publishes their copy to GitHub. Follow `readme-spec.md` next to this file:
   required sections, the link set (gallery, this template's page, a category
   page per tag, docs, download), and the house rule of no em or en dashes.
   Read two or three existing catalog READMEs first, then write this one from
   the template's own scenes. Do not reword another template's.

7. **Generate the poster, then look at it:**
   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @genmotion/templates poster <id>
   ```
   Read the resulting `packages/templates/catalog/<id>/poster.jpg` (the Read
   tool renders images). If it lands mid-word-flip or mid-sentence, trace the
   first scene's actual `interpolate`/`Sequence` timing to find a settled,
   legible frame and set `sampleAt` in `template.json`, then regenerate.

8. **Describe every scene for the scene library** (`scenes.json`; a catalog
   test fails without it). Agents building *other* videos search this to see
   how a hook, an integrations beat or an end card was done, so write it for
   them: one entry per scene file with its `beat` (the narrative job, from
   `SCENE_BEATS` in `src/scene-search.ts`), a specific `title`, a `summary` of
   what is on screen (quote the real copy), `build` (the reusable
   implementation idea and the components that hold it), `reuse` (when to
   borrow it, what to swap, what brand bits not to copy), `techniques`,
   `mood`, `videoTypes` (owner skill ids), `quality` (`hero` / `solid` /
   `filler`; filler is hidden from search) and `standalone`. Read every scene
   and its components in full first; an existing `scenes.json` shows the
   register. Then capture the three-frame filmstrips and look at a few:
   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @genmotion/templates scene-stills <id>
   ```
   Adjust an entry's `sampleAt` (three fractions) when a frame lands on a blank
   fade. Neither file nor `stills/` travels with a remix.

9. **Render the video and upload to R2** — see the next section.

10. **Run the tests:**
   ```sh
   pnpm --filter @genmotion/templates test
   pnpm --filter @genmotion/templates typecheck
   ```
   Failure modes worth knowing: "bundles and smoke-renders every scene" catches
   real scene bugs; "every declared audio path resolves to a real file" catches
   a manifest audio reference that didn't get copied; "fits the remix budget"
   is the 12MB check.

## Rendering a template's video

`render-video.mjs` drives headless Chromium frame-by-frame through the same
render host `poster.mjs` uses, encodes with ffmpeg, muxes in the manifest's
audio, and uploads the result to R2 at a fixed key (`templates/<id>/video.mp4`
— re-running overwrites it in place, nothing else needs updating).

```sh
pnpm --filter @genmotion/templates render-video              # every template
pnpm --filter @genmotion/templates render-video <id>          # just one
```

Needs the root `.env`'s S3 vars set (`S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`,
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) — same store every other upload
in this repo already uses. **Check what `S3_ENDPOINT` actually points at
before running this against every template** — in this repo's root `.env` it
is the *real* Cloudflare R2 bucket, not local MinIO, even with Docker's local
stack up (MinIO sits there unused unless something is reconfigured to point at
it). Uploading is real, hard-to-fully-undo infrastructure activity against a
production bucket — confirm with the user before a first bulk run, the same
way you'd confirm before any other outward-facing action; a single template as
a check, then the rest, is a reasonable way to do that.

This is a **manual, local step**, not something CI or a deploy runs — there is
deliberately no test that asserts a template's video already exists in R2 (that
would make the test suite depend on network/credentials it doesn't otherwise
need). A template that hasn't been rendered yet just shows its poster with no
playable video, both in the desktop app and on the web, until someone runs
this.

### On-screen video and oversized images

A scene can embed a real `<Video>` overlay (a face-cam, a screen recording), not
just `<Img>`/`<Audio>` — `prequel-launch` does. That, and any image over the
512KB inline limit, leaves the same `TRIPWIRE_PREFIX` placeholder in the
bundled scene code. `render-video.mjs` resolves every one of them during the
render: it rewrites the placeholder to a fake origin
(`https://gm-template-asset.internal`) and answers every request to it
straight from the template's own `assets/` folder via a Playwright
`context.route()` handler — no real network involved, and no size limit
enforced. This is what makes an on-screen `<Video>` actually play back
correctly frame-by-frame instead of rendering as a blank box.

If a render ever does produce a visibly broken frame for an asset, it's not
this mechanism failing silently — check first that the referenced file
actually exists on disk under `assets/` (the catalog test "every scene
bundles, and every asset it leaves unlined is real" already checks this).

## Refreshing a template after its source project changes

When the user says they've edited the source project and asks to re-add it —
don't try to patch just the bits that changed. Diff first to see the scope:

```sh
diff ~/.genmotion/projects/<slug>/project.json packages/templates/catalog/<id>/project.json
diff <(ls ~/.genmotion/projects/<slug>/scenes) <(ls packages/templates/catalog/<id>/scenes)
```

That's usually enough to tell whether it's a timing tweak or a real content
change. Then:

1. `rm -rf packages/templates/catalog/<id>/` — delete the old copy entirely.
   Patching in place risks leaving a removed scene, a renamed asset, or a
   stale import lying around from the version that's gone.
2. Redo the add-a-template checklist from step 1 (or from step 2 if the
   referenced-asset list is unchanged) against the *current* state of the
   source project.
3. `template.json`'s content (title/description/tags/category/featured/order) usually
   doesn't need to change just because timing or an asset did — reuse it
   as-is unless the update actually changed what the template is *about*.
4. Re-render the video (it's now stale even though the file on disk is
   untouched — the composition's timing or content changed underneath it).

## Where the video actually gets served from

Nothing serves scene bundles to a client anymore — every public gallery/detail
page (desktop and web alike) just plays `GET /api/templates/:id/video`, which
proxies the R2 object (Range-aware, so seeking works). The **only** place raw
project source still travels over the wire is `GET /api/templates/:id/files`
(what a remix writes to disk) — that route is untouched by any of this and
needs no re-render to stay correct; it packages the actual source files
directly. If a template's *source* changes (a scene edit, a new asset) without
re-running `render-video`, the remix will reflect the change immediately but
the played-back video will be stale until the next render — that staleness is
expected and is why `render-video` is step 7 of the add-a-template checklist,
not a one-time setup task.

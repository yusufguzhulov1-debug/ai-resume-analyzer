# Format recipes

Read this when you write the cue sheet for a specific kind of video. Frames at 30 fps (×0.8 at 24 fps). Levels assume normalised sources (VO and music at −16 LUFS, SFX peaks at −3 dBFS). Master: −14 LUFS / −1 dBTP unless noted. The owner skill sets the beats; this file sets the sound on them.

## Launch film (20–90 s)

- **Music**: instrumental build-and-drop, 110–128 BPM (ask for 120: 15 f per beat; a sourced track keeps its measured BPM, frames computed from it: 117 BPM = 15.385 f/beat, `beat-sync.md`). Drop on the product reveal.
- **Shape**: frame 1 transient → problem section sparse and low → riser 2–4 s (one or two bars) into the **drop on the reveal** → feature montage, a cut every 1–2 beats, each feature landing with a click or a tonal note on the bar → breakdown under the key line → logo on the last hit, 1–3 s tail.
- **SFX**: 5–8 hero moments. A tap 0.8 on the press that starts each flood (or nothing), impact 0.7–0.85 on slams and the logo, click 0.9 on taps; no whooshes (SKILL.md, the ban).
- **Levels**: music-only films at 1.0; with SFX 0.5–0.6; VO-led: bed 0.18 (the ladder's 0.1–0.2) with VO at 1.0, +3 to +8 f after each cut.
- House examples: a fintech launch at music 0.55 with taps and impacts; a voice-AI launch with a sparse bed under VO and rings on the cuts the picture marks.
- **No drop in the track?** Take the detector's biggest entry, or a DOWN bar followed by an UP bar (`beat-sync.md`), and cue the track with `startFrom` so it lands on the reveal frame.

## Explainer with VO (40–120 s)

- **Order**: write and place the VO first; music and SFX fit around it.
- **Music**: 90–110 BPM, sparse, no lead melody. Bed 0.18 per the ladder (fade in 30, split near the end and fade out 45). Optional duck up to ≈ 0.7 in pauses ≥ 1.5 s.
- **Cuts**: each section starts on a downbeat right after a VO pause; VO +6 f after each cut (house: 8 of 8).
- **SFX**: light UI sounds, at most one per 2–3 s; when the bed drops out, let the last cue's tail decay rather than filling the gap.
- **Ending**: music button under the CTA.

## Text-led film with no VO (explainer, product story)

- **Music-led at 1.0**: the track is the film. Sparse, no lead melody, so on-screen text stays the focus.
- **Drop it on the breath, bring it back on the peak**: cue the track (`startFrom`) or edit it so a natural dropout (the detector's DOWN bar before an UP bar, `beat-sync.md`) sits on `direction`'s breath and the return lands on the peak frame. That alignment usually beats back-timing the ending (SKILL.md, Beat grid); end on a 30–45 f fade on a bar line under the held last card.
- Sparse cues on the reveals the film hinges on (a tick as a packet crosses, a click on the key moment), never under every text line.
- **Headroom**: with cues on top, pre-master the cued music to −15 LUFS / −3 dBTP, place cues at ≤0.7 (placeholders included), and re-master the export (SKILL.md, Headroom and loudness). A −1.5 dBTP bed with cues at 1.0 exported over −1 dBTP.
- **Mid-phrase start**: aligning the dropout to the breath fixes `startFrom`, so frame 1 is mid-phrase. Fade in over ≥15 f and put a cue on frames 1–3.

## Picture-led designed sound (no music, no VO)

A muted-first launch, a calm hardware or data film, a film whose content is many sound events: the picture carries the meaning and sound is the reward for unmuting (SKILL.md, Sparse, picture-led films).

- **Cues lead**: 5–20 designed cues on the film's events (a tone per unit, a tick per crossing, the hit on the peak, a 2–4 note sonic logo on the mark). Each cue's loudest 50 ms RMS sits **≥12 dB above any bed** (`mix-and-loudness.md`, Sparse mixes); only the hit and the sonic logo take the top two levels, and transition pings sit under the action cues they bracket.
- **Bed**: none, or music or a tonal pad (`sfx-cues.md`'s ambient pad), shaped per section (out for the named breath, lighter after the peak). **Never synthesised noise, room tone or "air"**: it reads as wind or hiss on phones. Gaps read as space when every cue decays naturally (tails faded over 80–150 ms, the hit and chimes left to ring) and cues sit on the visible events.
- **Many events**: one stem from the scene's event schedule with the many-events rules (`sfx-cues.md`, Many events); heroes (first, last, isolated) at full level.
- **Master**: feeds (X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Kickstarter, Product Hunt) at **−14 LUFS integrated, ≤ −1 dBTP, LRA about 4–10 LU**, measured on the final stereo file, with no tail cut off; recorded clicks and keys need the cue-stem recipe (`mix-and-loudness.md`, Mastering a sparse film of real transients), synthesised tones survive the computed-ceiling re-master. −16 to −18 LUFS only for a site hero, an autoplay-muted embed or a long-form player, where no louder neighbour plays next to it. The peak cue is the loudest event and the sonic logo sits ≥ 2 dB under it.

## Brand sting (2–8 s)

- **Sequence**: a tonal build or ticks into the lock-up (0.5–1.5 s; a riser only if tonal, never a noise swell) → **impact on the settle frame** → tonal button (2–4 notes or a chord) → shimmer tail 1–1.5 s. About 3 s of sound.
- **Source**: a music generator with a 3–5 s length, or `sfx` ("short bright three-note synth logo jingle, ending on a sustained chord, 2.5 seconds").
- **Levels**: logo hit 0.9; no bed. No sub drop if the sting will precede speech.
- **The anticipation has sound too** (ticks on the swing, a tonal build): a sound-on sting never opens on more than 0.5 s of silence.
- **Contrast**: the impact's first 10 ms RMS is ≥8 dB above the riser's last 100 ms, and the riser has no dip over 6 dB; lower the riser until it passes (`sfx-cues.md` has the measurement).
- **Loop variant**: the last frame's sound must decay to silence before the loop point.

## UGC / social ad (6–60 s, vertical)

- **Frame 1**: a transient, never a fade-in.
- **Music**: trend-adjacent 95–130 BPM, cut on beats; bed 0.12–0.2 under talk (the ladder). Brand TikTok accounts use the Commercial Music Library in-app; never export a trending sound into the file.
- **SFX**: nothing on jump cuts; a hit on the product shot; a pop (0.45) on caption keywords, sparingly; foley on product handling.
- **Muted**: captions carry every claim.

## Trailer / teaser (30–150 s)

- **Act 1**: quiet, emotional, 60–80 BPM, sparse hits.
- **Act 2**: pulses and percussion, rhythm accelerating, a braam on each act break, each break a dropout.
- **Act 3**: everything firing, hits on every cut, pulse 120–140.
- **Title**: riser → **hard cut to 0.5–1.5 s of silence** (the riser's own tail decays into it over 80–150 ms, never a truncation) → title hit (braam + sub drop) → optional button (one last hit or joke).
- **The climax peaks**: its last 2–3 s are the loudest and densest, carried by a riser into the hard stop, never a flat plateau that just stops.
- **Loudness as a staircase**: automate the music's volume per act (0.6 → 0.85 → 1.0) and limit peaks only (SKILL.md recipe). Never `loudnorm` the whole cue: its `dynamic` fallback flattens the build. Measure each section's integrated loudness; it rises act by act.
- **A score with no steady pulse** (orchestral, an end-credits cue): cut on phrases and swells, and take isolated hits from elsewhere in the track as separate clips for the title and end card.
- Dialogue lines sit in the gaps between hits; a cold-open line sits 6–10 LU under Act 1's music. From a finished film mix, lift lines with the shaped chain in `video-editing` (no denoise). LRA is wider than a promo's (9–13 LU); −14 LUFS still.

## Podcast clip (15–90 s, vertical)

- Dialogue rules everything: speech at −16 LUFS (deliver −14 for social, −16 for podcast feeds).
- No music under talk by default; if the user wants one, 0.1 (−20 dB), low-passed. Optional 1–2 s intro sting and outro tail.
- A pop or click on caption emphasis is optional and rare. VO fades 2–3 f to remove breath clicks.

## Talking head (YouTube, 1–15 min)

- Speech at −16 to −14 LUFS short-term. Music only on the intro, b-roll stretches and section stings (1–2 bars); bed 0.12–0.2 under speech when present (the ladder), out under the key line.
- A pop or click on graphics, nothing on zoom punches or cuts; a boom on a rare emphasis joke.
- Jump cuts in the recording are filled with that recording's own room tone (harvested from its quietest stretch, `video-editing`), never a synthesised one.

## Gen Z edit (7–45 s): two different films

Decide which one it is first, because the cutting authority flips.

**Over speech** (a talking head cut TikTok-style, the common case):
- The speech decides every cut; a beat grid would cut mid-word.
- Bed: lo-fi, house or phonk at 0.14–0.2, low-passed at 6–8 kHz so it is heard on a phone without masking the voice (14–20 LU under it). Drop it to silence under the hook line and the payoff, and bring it back on the next cut.
- SFX: 3–6 per 30 s on the interrupts (pop on a text pop, a ding on a key number, hit on the reveal; angle changes stay silent), each 6–12 dB under the voice peak. No `sfx`? Synthesise them (`sfx-cues.md`).
- Dated: a library jazz or ukulele bed reads as 2010s YouTube. If that is the only bed available, prefer no bed and more sound design.

**Music-led** (a montage, no speech):
- Phonk, drill or house at 130–160 BPM (or half-time). Cuts on beats or half bars, with the big changes on bar 1; not on every beat for 30 s straight, which reads as a template.
- A speed-ramp hit on the drop; a low-shelf boost (+3 to +6 dB for one bar) on the drop if pre-rendering the track.
- Meme-style hits, one per joke, generated look-alikes only.

Both: master −14 LUFS / −1 dBTP.

## UI demo / screen walkthrough (15–90 s)

- No music, or minimal tech / lo-fi at 100–120 BPM at 0.1 under VO (0.5 with no VO).
- **A click per interaction** on the press frame (0.8–1.0), varied in level ±0.04 and alternating tracks; screen transitions silent (or the click that caused them); a typing loop under text entry; a success chime on completion; every tail decays, no bed under the gaps.
- Strip the recording's own audio before placing it.

## Milestone / stat announcement (6–20 s)

- House templates in this family ship silent; this is the obvious upgrade.
- **Music**: music-led at 1.0, 120 BPM so the count can step on beats.
- **SFX** (levels per `sfx-cues.md`): a tick per count step or per digit roll (4 f fade), accelerating with the count; an **impact on the frame the final number lands** with a short shimmer; confetti or burst with a soft pop.
- Hold the number through the music's button.

## Chat / message ad (10–30 s)

- One sound per bubble **on its first visible pixel**: received 0.85–0.9, sent 0.75–0.9; trim each file's leading silence with `startFrom`.
- Bed 0.136 (−17 dB) under bubbles, fade in 18, out 45; or music at 1.0 with no VO.
- Tap pop 1.0 on the press frame.

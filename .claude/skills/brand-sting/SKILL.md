# Brand sting

The shortest thing in the pack and the least forgiving: one mark, arriving well or badly, in a few seconds, with nothing to hide behind. A sting is half motion and half sound; the hit has to land on the frame the mark locks. Frames at 30 fps. Read `direction` first; moves come from `motion-language`, the sonic logo from `sound-design`.

> **These are references, not rules.** The numbers, beat sheets, style families and examples here are starting points distilled from work that landed well, not a recipe to fill in. The user's instructions always win over anything in this skill. When a different idea serves the brief better, propose it and try it: change the structure, break a default, invent a device, and write what you changed and why in `VIDEO.md`. What stays fixed is correctness: determinism, legibility and safe zones, loudness and clipping, licences and credits, never putting words in a real person's mouth, and the sound bans in `sound-design` (no whoosh; never a synthesised noise bed, room tone or "air", which reads as wind or hiss on phones). The checks at the end are a quality bar to clear, not a template to reproduce.

## When to use

- "Logo animation for our brand", an intro or outro bumper, a channel ident, a reveal for an event screen, a looping lockup.
- The closing lockup of a `launch-playbook` or `announce-*` film that needs to be built properly instead of a fade.

Another owner fits better when:

| The ask is really | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| A launch narrative that ends on the logo | `launch-playbook` |
| A brand guidelines film (palette, type, applications) | `freeform-video` with style family I |
| A long title sequence for a talk or event (over 8 s) | `freeform-video` |

## Ask first

1. **Do you have the logo file?** SVG is best, a large PNG is fine. Never redraw an existing mark from memory: slightly wrong is worse than absent.

**No logo file** (the one policy; `launch-playbook` and `three-assets` follow it too):

- Default: **set the name as a wordmark** in the brand's face (or the house face, Inter 500), and build the sting on it. Inter is the default unless the brief's feeling rules it out ("warm", "crafted", "not techy", "luxury", "playful"): then pick one OFL face that matches (a soft serif such as Fraunces for crafted and warm, a geometric sans for playful), list it under **I assumed**, and offer to swap in the brand face.
- The user *described* a mark (a new studio with no file yet, "a leaf that is also a flame") and said "just make it": you may build a **stand-in** from geometry to that description. Keep it in one file (`components/brand.ts`) so the real file replaces it 1:1, write it under "I assumed" in `VIDEO.md` as "stand-in mark built from your description, not your logo", and ask for the real file in your reply before anyone ships it.
- A known brand whose logo exists somewhere: never draw it; ask for the file, and use the wordmark meanwhile.
- Never call anything you built "the logo".
2. **Where is it used: before videos, after them, as a loop, or over other footage?** It decides the length, the ending and whether a key-colour version is needed.
3. **How should it feel?** Offer two options with a recommendation (for example "precise and calm" with no overshoot, or "playful" with one 6–10% overshoot).

## Pick the shape

| Shape | What happens | Wins when | House device |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Build** | Pieces assemble into the mark: strokes drawing on, tiles rolling, letters arriving | A geometric or modular mark that reads mid-assembly | Brand grid: 7 cells roll like a slot machine (one face every 24f, each roll 11f inOutCubic, cells 3f apart), the wordmark rises 22f outSmooth (y 22 px) |
| **Reveal** | The mark is there but hidden; something uncovers it: a mask, a light sweep, an iris | A simple mark that needs no explaining | Nike guide: the swoosh clip-draws over 16f outSmooth with a 26 px lift |
| **Transform** | Something else becomes the mark: a shape morphs, a UI element or the film's motif resolves into it | The film or the brand already has a motif that can plausibly become the logo | Codex: the writer blob swells and resolves into the mark; Gojiberry: a camera slam into a word, white flash, the mark pops |

Transform has its own rules:

- The thing before the mark (the **precursor**) must **read as itself on a still frame**: a metronome arm is one continuous rod on a pivot, not two spikes pinched at a point; check one frame at full resolution.
- It must also read **as what it means**: a pointer that "finds" something needs a direction (one end solid or bright, the other shaded or outlined); a seed that sprouts needs a visible top and bottom. Otherwise the verb the idea depends on cannot be seen.
- The moment it starts becoming the mark needs a **trigger beat**: a click, a glint, a snap to position, with its own sound. The trigger is the first frame of the build, never followed by a pause.
- **Precursor-only parts are gone by the lock**: hubs, pivots, bezels, rings, ticks, dial faces and any shading the mark does not have. Collapse or fade them during the build (they belong to the anticipation), so the lock frame shows only the mark. A leftover hub reads as a hole or a dust spot at lockup size.
- **The transforming element also delivers the name.** A Transform that ends with the name fading on by itself is two stings stitched together. Let the element that became the mark write the name in: an arm or stroke that keeps travelling along the baseline as a thin line and wipes the letters in behind it, **reaching the last letter on the lock frame**; a light that leaves the symbol and sweeps through the name; a mask that opens from the edge that points at the name. The stagger recipes under Mark craft are for Build and Reveal, or a Transform whose element cannot plausibly carry on.

Pick one. A sting that builds, then reveals, then transforms is three stings.

## Direction defaults

- **Style family**: I (brand identity loop) by default: the brand's own colours on a plain field, a visible grid only if the brand uses one. C (3D product hero) for an extruded, glossy mark in a Three.js project. A (beat-cut) for a hype bumper cut to a track.
- **Background**: the brand's hex, exact at the frame's centre and corners on the export (±2 levels). No vignette, no grain (`three-look`'s brand-identity row). A lift, if any, is a declared tint of the brand's own colour.
- **Energy curve**: anticipation (3) → **hit (10) at 40–60% of the length** → settle and hold (4). **The breath is inside the build**: in the 6–10f before the lock, *fewer things* move and the sound thins (the riser is the only thing growing), but the breath reduces how many pieces move, never the speed of the last one: one piece is still travelling on lock −1 and arrives on the lock frame. A fade is not an arrival, a long ease is not an arrival (anything ≥ 6f long has visually arrived several frames early), and a group glide that ends at lock −6 leaves the hit landing on a picture that has already stopped. A still beat *before* the build is a stall, not a breath.
- **Frame 0 is already moving**: the anticipation's motion has started by frame 15 (a ring part-drawn, a pointer mid-swing), and it fills a deliberate part of the frame with visual **mass**, not just span: the precursor's bounding box is **≥ 35% of the frame's short edge** and **≥ 3% of the frame's area is visible ink** (a 30 px-wide stroke 300 px tall is a line, not a subject: give it a ring, ticks or rays that later collapse into the mark, or widen it), not a speck in a large dead field. Measure both on frame 0. Fill it with **motion**, not size: never start oversized and pull out, because a shrinking, calming subject drains the energy the build needs. The anticipation's energy rises into the trigger (a swing that tightens and quickens, a sweep that accelerates), and the build's first 10f change more than the anticipation's last 10f.
- **Transitions**: none inside a sting; for an outro, the incoming film's last element persists into the build (transform shape).
- **Sound**: the sonic logo, about 3 s: a tonal build or ticks into the lock (0.5–1.5 s; a riser only if tonal, never a whoosh or noise swell, per `sound-design`'s ban) → impact on the settle frame → a 2–4 note tonal button → shimmer tail 1–1.5 s. No VO, no bed. **This skill's sound rules win over `sound-design`'s general ones for a sting**: anticipation ticks may run several per second (one on each pass of a swing), and the first sound may sit on the anticipation's first motivated event inside the first 0.5 s instead of on frame 1.
- **Memorable moment**: the lock frame itself, and it must be a **picture** event, not only a sound. **The lock's picture event is the largest change in the last 6f, measured on a crop of the whole lockup** (symbol and name): the mean absolute difference between lock −1 and lock is larger than between any other two neighbouring frames from lock −6 to lock. It comes from one of:
  - a **≤ 4f move** that ends on the lock (the last letter written in by the wipe, the last piece seating, a 2–3f scale seat of 1.5–3%);
  - a **light event that travels across the whole lockup**, symbol and name, peaking on the lock frame (a sweep, not a glint on one facet of the symbol while the name, often three times its area, sits still).
  The trigger (the snap that starts the build) and the lock use **different devices**: a point glint on the snap, a sweep or an arrival on the lock, never the same flare twice at two sizes, and never a whiteout that flattens the mark off-model. Measure a glint or sweep as a luma change on the crop: on a near-white mark, run it across the darker tone or as a darker-to-light band, or it is invisible. Even a calm sting has a lock event; calm decides its size, not its absence. It never needs a full-frame flash.

## Frame budgets

| Length | Anticipation | Build / reveal | **Lock (hit)** | Tagline | Hold to end |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 s bumper (60f) | — | 0–15 | **15** | — | 15–60 (45f) |
| 3 s (90f) | 0–12 | 12–40 | **40** | 52–64 (12f blurUp) | 40–90 (50f) |
| 4 s (120f) | 0–20 | 20–56 | **56** | 60–72 | 56–120 (64f) |
| 5 s (150f), default | 0–36 | 36–72 | **72** | 90–102 | 72–150 (78f) |
| 8 s intro (240f) | 0–90 | 90–120 | **120** | 140–152 | 120–240 (120f) |

- **Anticipation** is continuous motion (a search, a swing, tiles rolling), never a settle followed by a wait. If it contains a damped swing, its last visible swing is where it ends (`motion-language`: amplitude under 1°, checked on a frame strip), so plan the build to start there.
- **Build** is ≥30f with its moves **staggered** across it (for example: arms extend 36–56, the lockup slides 46–66, the name tracks in 56–72), never four moves stacked into the last 15f.
- The hold after lock is ≥45f (1.5 s) at every length. It is the only frame anyone remembers. The one exception is a beat-cut bumper inside a music film, where 10–30f is the style.
- A reveal that takes more than 2 s (60f) starts to feel like a wait; a build may run 3–4 s if every step reads.
- Past 8 s it is no longer a sting but a title sequence: use `freeform-video`.

## Mark craft

- **Size**: the symbol's larger dimension is 25–40% of the frame's short edge (270–430 px tall on 1920 × 1080; up to 60% of the width on 9:16, centred at 40–45% of the height). Clear space on every side ≥ the mark's cap height, or the brand's own clear-space rule.
- **Horizontal lockup** (symbol + name side by side): the whole lockup is 55–70% of the frame width, the wordmark's cap height is 0.3–0.4× the symbol's height (Inter's caps are 0.727 em: a 96 px cap height is a 132 px font size), and the gap between symbol and name is about 0.25× the symbol's height (0.75–1× the cap height). Centre the lockup optically as one unit, not the symbol. When the ranges collide (a long name such as a 9-letter uppercase wordmark), **lockup width wins**: keep it at 55–70%, take the symbol to 25–28% of the short edge, and set the wordmark one weight heavier (500 rather than 400) so it holds its own beside a dense symbol. A tracking-close on the wordmark anchors at the edge nearest the symbol (`three-type`'s `track(em, "left")`), so the letters never travel into the gap. Clear space is measured in the wordmark's cap height.
- **Real geometry**: copy the SVG paths verbatim. Recolour only to the brand's documented variants (full colour, one-colour, reversed).
- **Landing ease**: marks land on the **gentle spring** (no overshoot) over 14–20f, scale 0.72–0.9 → 1, or a long-tail ease-out (outQuart or outExpo). A decelerating ease cannot be the lock event on its own: its last step is its smallest, so it reads as arriving 2–3 frames early. The lock event **accelerates or steps in** over ≤ 4f (inQuad/inCubic into the lock, a 1.5–2% scale seat of the whole lockup, a tint step, a glint): the long ease brings the pieces home, the short event lands them. Overshoot (1.06, outBack c1 1.28) only when the user chose playful, and only on the lock.
- **Wordmarks**: letters 1.4–2f apart, each 4–10f; or a tracking close from +0.32em to the final tracking over 15f (Gojiberry's wordmark). An uppercase wordmark settles at +0.08 to +0.16em (sentence-case ones at −0.01 to −0.03em); sizes and kerning per `three-type`.
  - **A tracking close that ends on the lock has visible travel into it**: the far letter still moves ≥ 2 px over the last 3f. A 15f outCubic leaves under 1% of its travel for those frames and reads as stopped; use outQuad over ≤ 15f, or outCubic over ≤ 8f, and check `travel × (3 / duration)^k ≥ 2 px` (k = 2 for outQuad, 3 for outCubic). Even then the close is not the lock's arrival on its own (it is a long ease): pair it with a ≤ 4f event on the lock.
  - **Uppercase letters never fade up on flat opacity**: mid-fade capitals are grey ghosts that read as loading. Reveal them through a mask (rising through a line just under the caps), a wipe (behind a moving edge), or a blur 6 → 0 with opacity on in ≤ 2f (`three-type` `references/reveals.md` §4 has both, tested).
- **Nothing passes through the type**: a symbol gliding to its lockup slot must not cross the wordmark's slot while the name is visible. Move the lockup as **one group** (symbol + name), so the name rides in beside the symbol; or bring the name in only after the symbol has cleared its slot.
- **During the build**: one secondary micro-motion at most (a light sweep, a few particles that converge); everything converges toward the lock frame, nothing arrives after it.
- **After lock**: exactly one ambient behaviour, never fully static (the house standard): a creep of ≤1% scale over the hold, or a breathe of ≤1% at 0.2 Hz. A hard cut into unrelated footage keeps it. Deliver a frozen-tail variant only when the user asks for one (a matched handoff into a specific shot); a loop handles its ends with the unbuild below.
- **Tagline**: only if the brief gives one (never invent copy; the budget row's tagline slot is then simply held lockup); enters once, ≥10f after the lock, blurUp 12f, ≤5 words, and holds to the end.

## The sonic logo

| Cue | Lands | Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tonal riser or ticks | `startFrame = lock − riserLength`, so it **ends on the lock frame** | 0.55–0.6 (−5 to −4.4 dB) |
| Impact | the lock frame ±1f (33 ms), layered: a 2–5 kHz transient + a 100–500 Hz body | 0.9 (−0.9 dB) |
| Tonal button | 0–4f after the impact: 2–4 notes or a chord | 0.6–0.8 |
| Tail | shimmer or reverb, 1–1.5 s, decaying to silence before the last frame | — |

- **The anticipation has sound too** (ticks on a swing, a tonal build, a soft tick as the search changes direction): with sound on, a sting never opens on more than 0.5 s of silence.
- **Contrast**: the impact's first 10 ms RMS is **≥8 dB above the riser's last 100 ms**, and the riser has no internal dip over 6 dB. Per-clip volumes do not guarantee this (sources are normalised differently); measure it (`sound-design`'s `references/sfx-cues.md`) and pull the riser down 6–8 dB at its top if it fails.

Generate with `sfx` or `music`, describing the sound, not the picture: "two warm synth notes rising for one second into a solid low hit with a bright three-note synth chime, ending in a soft shimmer, 3 seconds, one-shot, no music". Generate 2–3 takes and pick by ear on the lock frame. No sub drop if the sting precedes speech. For a loop, the tail must reach silence before the loop point.

## Directed example: 5 s ident, music-free, 16:9

```markdown
## Direction
SMP: Small pieces, one system.
Idea: We show the modular mark as tiles that roll into place like a slot machine settling.
Style family: I brand identity loop — the mark is modular, the grid is the brand
Energy curve: 3 (tiles idle) → hit 10 at frame 72 → 4 hold
Sound: sfx-led (riser texture matched to the Feeling: a filtered tonal swell for calm, a brighter, faster tonal riser for energetic; never a noise swell) — tile clicks 0.45 alternating lanes from frame 0, riser 0.55 from 42 to 72, impact 0.9 on 72 (≥8 dB over the riser's top), three-note chime from 74, tail to 135
Memorable moment: 64–72 — the last three tiles land 3f apart and the wordmark locks on the hit

## Beats
| # | Frames | Job | On screen | Sound cue |
| 1 | 0–36 | Anticipation | 7 tiles already rolling at frame 0, one face every 24f, 11f per roll | Clicks per roll |
| 2 | 36–72 | Build | A snap on 36 starts it; tiles land centre-out 3f apart from 40; the lockup group (tiles + wordmark) rises 22f outSmooth from 50 | Riser 42–72, thinning only in 64–72 |
| 3 | 72 | Lock | The last tile and the wordmark land | Impact + chime |
| 4 | 90–102 | Tagline | "Build anything" blurUp 12f | — |
| 5 | 102–150 | Hold | 0.8% scale creep, nothing else | Tail decays by 135 |
```

## Variants

- **Outro / transform**: the film's last element (a card, a colour flood, a cursor) persists into the sting's frame 0 and becomes the first piece of the build.
- **Loop** (event screens, a site hero): the last frame equals the first. Run build → hold → unbuild (the build reversed at 0.6× its duration, ease-in) → the same empty frame; every ambient cycle divides the loop length exactly.
- **Overlay over other footage**: GenMotion's exports (MP4, WebM, MOV) carry **no alpha channel**, so a transparent sting cannot be rendered directly; say so before promising one. Deliver: (a) a version on a flat key colour that appears nowhere in the mark (#00FF00 for most marks, #0000FF for green ones), built with no glow, blur or motion blur crossing the mark's edge; and (b) an alpha file keyed from it with `ffmpeg`:

  ```
  ffmpeg -i sting-key.mp4 -vf "colorkey=0x00FF00:0.25:0.05,format=yuva444p10le" -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 4 sting-alpha.mov
  ```

  Check the edge on a captured frame over black and over white; a fringe means the similarity value (0.25) needs raising or the mark has a soft edge that should be hardened. For marks that glow on dark, a black-background version used with a screen blend mode is often cleaner than a key.

## Building it

- **Three.js (default)**: `three-assets` loads the SVG paths (shapes or extruded geometry) and textures; `three-look` sets the stage: **flat by default** (family I: the `flat` pipeline, exact brand hex, the mark's own flat tones, depth only from the mark's own shading), and **extruded and lit only for family C** (a 3D product-hero sting: three tones of the brand colour on face, bevel and side). A stand-in mark in family I is flat facets in the brand's tones with no gradient or specular highlight, so it matches the flat wordmark beside it. When the feeling is crafted, warm or handmade, a geometric stand-in reads as an app icon: draw organic shapes (an asymmetric tongue rather than a teardrop, a tilt, a crease), no uniform sticker outline, and allow a hand-made edge texture on the mark only (the ground stays the flat brand hex). `three-type` for the wordmark if it is set type rather than artwork; layered flat facets are ordered per `three-assets` (three.js sorts by the parent Group's `renderOrder` first). `three-camera` only if the camera moves (a slow push or an orbit of 10–30° that settles before the lock), and `three-transitions` only for an outro handoff, a flash or an iris: a locked single-scene sting needs neither. Clip-draw is a shader or a growing mask plane; tile rolls are planes whose UV offset follows the roll curve.
- **HyperFrames**: the SVG inline in one composition; strokes drawn with dash offsets on the timeline; the hit as an `<audio>` element at the lock time.
- **React**: the SVG as a component; `@genmotion/motion` springs (`gentle`, time-scaled to the landing length) and `interpolate` for dash offsets.

## Good and bad

- Bad: the logo fades in over 1 s, a sound plays somewhere near it, the logo drifts and shimmers forever. Good: four strokes draw on 3f apart, the last one locks on frame 72 with the impact on 72, the tagline rises at 90, and only a 0.8% creep moves after.
- Bad: a pointer settles at f32, nothing moves or sounds until f58, then four moves cram into f58–72. Good: the pointer searches until f33, snaps home with a tick and a point glint on 36, and the build runs 36–72 with its moves staggered.
- Bad: the symbol forms, then the name fades on letter by letter as grey half-letters, and the lock frame differs from lock −1 only by a glint on one facet. Good: the arm that became the symbol carries on as a thin line along the baseline, writes the name in behind it, passes the last letter on the lock, and the impact lands on that frame.
- Bad: a grain-and-vignette backdrop that boils on a brand hex. Good: the brand's midnight, flat and exact at centre and corners.
- Bad: a redrawn approximation of the mark in brand-ish blue. Good: the user's SVG, paths copied verbatim, in the documented colour.
- Bad: "transparent version attached" (an MP4 that is black around the logo). Good: a key-colour MP4, a keyed ProRes 4444 file, and a note on how to use each.

## Checks before you finish

1. `capture-frames` on the lock frame and the last frame: the mark is exact (paths, colours, proportions match the file, or the stand-in is flagged in `VIDEO.md`), unclipped, with clear space ≥ its cap height.
2. The symbol's larger dimension measures 25–40% of the frame's short edge on the lock frame; a horizontal lockup is 55–70% of the width and centred as one unit.
3. The lock sits at 40–60% of the length; capture lock −1, lock, lock +1: the last piece arrives exactly on the lock frame. On a crop of the whole lockup, the change from lock −1 to lock is the largest between neighbouring frames from lock −6 to lock (`ffmpeg` `tblend=all_mode=difference,signalstats` on the crop, compare YAVG per frame). A tracking close's far letter moves ≥ 2 px over the last 3f.
4. Motion has started by frame 15, frame 0's precursor spans ≥ 35% of the short edge with ≥ 3% of the frame in visible ink, the subject is not shrinking through the anticipation, and a strip of every 4th frame from 0 to the lock shows no run of more than 10f where nothing changes. The build is ≥30f with staggered moves; a Transform's precursor reads as itself on one full-resolution frame.
5. Capture every frame of the build (or a strip of every 2nd): no moving element crosses a visible word; no frame shows grey, half-opaque capitals; by the lock, no precursor-only part (hub, ring, bezel, tick) is left on the mark.
6. The hold after the lock is ≥45f with exactly one ambient behaviour; consecutive held frames of the export, measured on a crop around the lockup, have PSNR > 45 dB (`ffmpeg -i a.png -i b.png -lavfi psnr -f null -`): the creep is there, but no grain boils.
7. Sample the export's background at the four corners and one clear patch near the centre (beside the mark, not under it) on the lock frame: each within ±2 levels of the brand hex (the export's YUV conversion alone can move a dark hex 1–2 levels; if a sample sits at −2, check the source frame from `capture-frames` before blaming the look).
8. The impact's onset is within 1 frame of the lock frame: compare the cue's start frame on the timeline with the lock constant the animation uses, then on the export's waveform.
9. Sound on: no silence over 0.5 s from frame 0 (`silencedetect=noise=-50dB:d=0.5` reports no `silence_start: 0`); the impact's 10 ms RMS is ≥8 dB above the riser's last 100 ms and the riser has no dip over 6 dB.
10. The tail decays to silence before the last frame of a loop; the loop's first and last frames match.
11. Overlay version: the key colour appears nowhere inside the mark; the keyed file shows a clean edge over black and over white.
12. `ebur128` on the export: true peak between −1 and −3 dBTP, so the impact is as loud as it can safely be (a sting is under 6 s, so integrated loudness is advisory here and `sound-design`'s ±1 LU rule does not apply; if the hit peaks below −3 dBTP, raise everything together). Audio and video streams are the same length (`ffprobe` both): pad the tail with silence rather than end the audio early.
13. The `direction` self-critique passes (a sting's Hook is judged on motion by frame 15); `validate` passes.

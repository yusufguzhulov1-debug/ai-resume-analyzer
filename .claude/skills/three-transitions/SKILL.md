# Transitions on Three.js: the how behind the handoff catalogue

`motion-language` holds the handoff catalogue: which handoff, how many frames, which sound, and the rule of one signature plus one workhorse per film (`direction` picks them). This skill is how each one is built when scenes are separate Three.js builders cut back to back.

Two facts shape everything here:

1. **Nothing crosses a cut.** At the cut the host tears down scene N's graph and builds scene N+1 from scratch. A "persisting" element is the same object built twice from the same numbers. A flood is a colour that both scenes agree on.
2. **The renderer never blends two scenes.** There is no crossfade between scenes and there should not be (the house uses plain crossfades on 0% of cuts). Every transition is something the two scenes do in their own last and first frames.

Code: `references/cover-layers.md` (one overlay shader for flood, iris, wipe, block wipe and flash), `references/carries.md` (persisting element, continuous loops, rush, whip with motion blur, exit-then-cut, board erase). Both build on `three-camera`'s `components/stage.ts` (`overlay()`, `PX`) and `components/ease.ts`.

## When to use

- A Three.js video has two or more scenes and you are planning how each ends and begins.
- A cut feels like a jump, or a flood/flash flickers at the cut.
- The Direction block names a signature (flood becomes object, iris, block wipe, flash-to-white, match-push, persisting element) and it must be built.

Not for: choosing the handoff (`direction`, `motion-language`), the camera rig itself (`three-camera`), the sound on the cut (`sound-design`).

## The contract, in Three.js terms

| Rule (`motion-language`) | How it is enforced here |
| --- | --- |
| Last 10–15f of N and first 10–15f of N+1 are one move | Plan both scenes' timelines together; write the handoff frame numbers into `components/handoff.ts` |
| The carrier is pixel-identical across the cut | Both scenes import the carrier's pose, colour and size from `components/handoff.ts` and build it with the same factory; never retype a number |
| Same picture means same rendering | Both scenes: same `fitCamera`, same `colorPipeline` mode, same lights, `scene.background` set; the carrier and cover layers `toneMapped: false` |
| Drift dies before a matched cut | `restDrift` (zero at both ends) or drift × (1 − transition progress) |
| Non-carriers gone 2–8f before the cut | Exit 6–9f inCubic, clear by `D − 3` when nothing carries the cut (`D − 8` when a carrier stays); the frame 2f before the cut shows only the carrier or the ground |
| Accelerate through the cut or land ≥10f early | Covers complete 2–5f before the cut and hold; camera carries use matching spline slopes (`three-camera`) |
| **A cover lands on content** | At most **4 background-only frames per turn** (a flat ground or a closed cover with no word, no product, no carrier on it): the next card's first word is on screen the frame the cover closes (or resolves inside the closing iris), and the next shot opens out of the card's last legible frame. Never stack a full cover and an exit-then-cut gap on one turn. A judged film closed an iris to black, *then* began its card, and exited the card to black, *then* opened: 6–8 empty frames at each of five turns, 1.2 s of nothing in 20 s |

## One cover layer for the whole film

Floods, irises, wipes, block wipes and flashes are all one full-frame plane on the camera-locked overlay (1 unit = 1 px, so radii and edges are in composition px), drawn by one shader:

| `uMode` | Draws | Handoffs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 flat | The colour at `uOpacity` | Flash-to-white, impact, fade to black (final frame only) |
| 1 disc | Inside radius `uRadius` around `uCenter` | Flood becomes object, iris-out, burst |
| 2 hole | Outside the radius | Iris-in onto an object |
| 3 wipe | Behind an edge travelling along `uDir` | Panel wipe, white wipe-up from the bottom, diagonal wipe |
| 4 blocks | 12 × 7 cells by sweep 0.62 + clump 0.24 + jitter 0.14 | Block wipe (textured families) |

- It lives on the camera, so camera moves, punches and shakes never uncover an edge; `renderOrder` 950 as a direct child of the overlay group (whose own order, 900, is what ranks it above `onTop()` type: three.js sorts by the parent Group's order first), no depth test, never picked.
- It is never tone mapped, and its colour is the next scene's background or carrier **exactly**: tested to the pixel across a cut.
- `screenPx(object, cam, width, height)` gives the on-screen point a flood should start from (the pressed button), and `coverRadius()` the radius that reaches the farthest corner × 1.05.

## Recipes at a glance

| Handoff | Scene N | Scene N+1 | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flood becomes object | Disc from the button, 10f inCubic, complete 3f early | Opens in that colour; disc contracts onto the object 13f, then fades as the real object takes over; the object is the **only moving thing for 6f** after it lands, at ≥ 6% of frame width | cover-layers §2 |
| Iris-in to an object | — | Hole shrinks from the frame to the object's radius over 30f | cover-layers §3 |
| White wipe-up | Wipe, last 8f, ease-in, 40 px feather | Opens white | cover-layers §4 |
| Block wipe | Cells grow out of an on-screen object of the wipe's colour, 18–24f | Starts covered, clears with the same cells; entrance clocks offset +12f (`prog(frame + 12, …)`) | cover-layers §5 |
| Flash-to-white | Ramp the last 4–8f, ease-in | Decay 6–9f | cover-layers §6 |
| Colour-field push | Panel slides over, 8–23f | Panel slides off; content carries 46 px → 0 over 16f | cover-layers §7 |
| Persisting element | Carrier lands on the handoff pose, no exit | Same factory, same pose on frame 0, then moves in its new role | carries §1 |
| Match-push | Push to the exact crop | Laid out at that crop's scale | `three-camera` moves §7 |
| Continuous loop | Spin or time from **film** frame | Same function, same film frame | carries §3 |
| Rush into the lens | Camera to 0.35 from the object, last 14f inCubic, ground to white | Opens white | carries §4 |
| Whip | Content flung out with sub-frame motion blur | Enters from the opposite side at the same speed | carries §5–6 |
| Exit-then-cut | Everything leaves, clear 2–3f early | First element 1–2f after the cut (≤ 4 empty frames in all) | carries §7 |
| Board erase | Strokes un-draw from `D − 18` over 10f, 8f blank | Identical blank paper | carries §8 |
| New ground behind the subject (no cut) | The backdrop's `uFlood` disc grows out of the subject, behind it; environment and key light follow in the same frames; the subject scales or moves | — (one continuous shot) | `three-look` backdrops-and-finish §7, color-and-light §7 |

## Picking the build for a film

- The signature handoff goes on chapter turns and the peak; the workhorse (usually exit-then-cut or a persisting element) on the rest. At most two transition styles besides plain cuts.
- Floods, irises and block wipes want a carrier on screen to motivate them: a button that is pressed, a mark, a dot, a chip in the wipe's colour. A flood or a wipe from nowhere is decoration.
- **The object a flood contracts into is the only moving thing for 6f after it lands**, and at least 6% of the frame's width; anything else arriving in those frames (new elements, a camera move, traffic crossing it) hides the "it became this" read. Its label is drawn above the disc, or fades 2f before the disc reaches it, so the disc never tears the label.
- **A colour change that is not a cut** (the ground turning behind a product, night to morning inside one shot) is not a cover: the cover layer sits on the camera above everything and would erase the subject. Grow it in the backdrop behind the subject and re-light the subject in the same frames (`three-look`, A new ground inside one shot). Without the re-light, a lit object goes dark on the new ground; without a scale change, it reads as a flat wipe.
- Flash-to-white on every cut only in a music film, with the cut on the hit. A flash contrasts ≥ 50% in mean luma with the frames either side, **measured within the flashing area** (crop to it), never into an already bright plate (there it reads as a bloom: flash out of the bright shot onto a darker one, or use the punch alone). On a letterboxed picture the flash plane covers the picture area only (a `PlaneGeometry(width, pictureHeight)` on the overlay); full-frame white over the black bars composites to grey bars.
- Motion blur is for the 8–10f around a whip, never a whole film: it multiplies render time by the sample count and the editor can't point at objects inside it.
- Fade to black only on the final frame or a chapter break of a long piece.

## A complete pair: flood becomes object

The LightPay handoff, as two scenes sharing one constant. Tested: the last frame of the first scene and the first frame of the second are the same colour to the pixel, and the disc then contracts onto the pill.

```ts
// components/handoff.ts
export const FLOOD = "#c8f31d";          // the flood colour IS the next scene's ground
export const PILL_R = 150;               // px: the disc lands at the pill's size

// scenes/01-hook.ts (frame callback): the pressed button floods the frame
const f = prog(frame, D - 13, 10, inCubic);                  // 10f ease-in, complete 3f early
const c = screenPx(button, cam, width, height);
cover.mesh.visible = f > 0;
cover.u.uMode.value = 1;
cover.u.uOpacity.value = 1;
cover.u.uCenter.value.set(c.x, c.y);
cover.u.uRadius.value = f * coverRadius(c.x, c.y, width / 2, height / 2);

// scenes/02-deposit.ts (frame callback): opens inside the flood, contracts into the pill
const k = prog(frame, 0, 13, inOutCubic);
const p = screenPx(pill, cam, width, height);
cover.mesh.visible = frame < 22;
cover.u.uMode.value = 1;
cover.u.uCenter.value.set(lerp(0, p.x, k), lerp(0, p.y, k));
cover.u.uRadius.value = lerp(coverRadius(0, 0, width / 2, height / 2), PILL_R, k);
cover.u.uOpacity.value = 1 - prog(frame, 13, 8, outCubic);   // the real pill takes over
```

Both scenes build `cover = coverLayer(width, height, FLOOD)` on `overlay(scene, cam, height)`. Sound: a tap on the press that starts the flood (or nothing), an optional soft land or impact one frame after the cut; never a whoosh (`sound-design`).

## Timing on both sides of a cut

| Handoff | Scene N (frames before the cut) | Scene N+1 (frames after) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flood becomes object | flood `D−13 … D−3`, hold | contract 0–13, release 13–21 |
| Persisting element | carrier lands by `D−6`, others gone by `D−8` | carrier moves from 4 for 16–22f |
| Match-push | push `D−34 … D−10`, hold | settle or creep from 0 |
| Flash-to-white | ramp `D−6 … D` | decay 0–8 |
| White wipe-up | `D−8 … D` | opens white |
| Block wipe | `D−22 … D−2` | clears 0–20, entrances offset +12f |
| Exit-then-cut | exits `D−10 … D−3` | first entrance at 1–2 |

## Building order for a multi-scene film

1. From the beat table in VIDEO.md, list every cut with its handoff (signature or workhorse) and its carrier.
2. Write `components/handoff.ts`: carrier poses, colours, crops, and the film-frame start of every scene (`SCENE_START`), matching `project.json`.
3. Build each scene's last 15f and the next scene's first 15f together, before the middles.
4. Capture both frames of every cut; fix mismatches by changing the shared constant, never one side.
5. Only then fill the middles of the scenes, and add sound cues at the frames the handoff table gives.

## Anti-patterns

- **Hoping an object "carries over".** It is rebuilt; if its numbers are not shared, it jumps.
- **A flood colour typed twice**, or tone mapped in one scene and not the other: a one-frame flicker at the cut.
- **The cover plane in world space**: a punch-in uncovers its edge. Put it on the overlay.
- **Drift running into a matched cut.**
- **Decelerating into the last frame** of a move that crosses the cut.
- **A different transition on every cut.**
- **Footage or late-loading images inside a motion-blurred scene**: the frame is accumulated before they land.
- **Randomness in a dissolve or block wipe**: cells come from a seeded hash and a fixed `uSeed`.

## Requirements

| Need | What | Fallback when it is missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checking each cut | `capture-frames` on the last frame of N and the first of N+1, side by side | None |
| Measuring a match | `ffmpeg` to sample the carrier's pixels in both frames of an export | Compare the shared constants by reading both scenes |
| Which handoff, how long, which sound | `motion-language`, `direction`, `sound-design` | — |

## Checks before you finish

1. For every cut, `capture-frames` on the last frame of N and the first of N+1: the carrier matches in position, size, rotation and colour (sample a pixel of floods; the values are identical).
2. Step through every turn: no more than 4 consecutive frames are background only (a flat ground or a closed cover with nothing on it), and no turn has both a full cover and an exit-then-cut gap; the frame 2f before each exit-then-cut shows background only; every cover completes 2–5f before its cut and the next card's first word is on it by the frame it closes; every block wipe's first cells touch an on-screen object of their colour.
3. Parked carriers (an object waiting in a node, a card set aside) sit in a reserved slot that clears every label on the first and last frame of each scene; one larger than its parking spot is hidden while parked.
4. Every handoff number exists once, in `components/handoff.ts`, imported by both scenes; continuous loops run on film frame and the scene-start table matches `project.json`.
5. Cover planes are on the camera overlay, `toneMapped: false`, `pickable = false`.
6. A frame checker flagging single-colour frames at flood or flash cuts shows the carrier colour, not an empty scene.
7. Each flash: crop the export to the flashing area and compare mean luma (`signalstats` YAVG) on the flash's peak frame and the frames either side: ≥ 50% of range apart. Each flood that contracts into an object: a strip of the 6f after it lands shows nothing else moving.
8. No randomness or wall-clock timing in any transition; block wipes use a fixed seed; `validate` passes.

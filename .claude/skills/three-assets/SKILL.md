description: "Bringing real material into Three.js scenes so no frame is blank: asset imports and their type declarations, images and screenshots at true aspect, logos rasterised crisp from SVG or extruded from the real path data with a bevel, device frames, user footage transcoded to WebM and seeked from the frame through the loading barrier (never played), fonts, confetti, piles of identical objects, resizable outlines, and why audio goes on the timeline with place-audio instead of in a scene. Load it when a Three.js scene uses a logo, screenshot, photo, recording, font, confetti or any file from assets/."

# Assets on Three.js: real files, loaded so every frame is complete

A scene may import only `three` and `@genmotion/three-engine`, so there are no addon loaders (no GLTFLoader, no SVGLoader) and no page globals. Everything here uses the core loaders, wired to `ctx.manager`: the host waits for that manager before it captures a frame, then draws again. Anything loaded around it ships as an empty plane in the frames that finish first.

The recipes were built against the real host and debugged by rendering. The thing you would not guess: the CLI's Chromium cannot decode **H.264 MP4** at all, so footage must be VP9 WebM, seeked through `ctx.manager`. `video-editing`'s `references/footage-in-scene.md` is the pack's one tested footage helper; `references/footage-and-audio.md` here has an equivalent for short inserts.

Code: `references/images-and-logos.md` (imports, `picture()`, `logoPlane()`, `extrudedMark()` with an SVG path parser, device frames), `references/drawn-ui.md` (`components/ui.ts`: app UI rebuilt as canvas-drawn planes when there are no screenshots), `references/footage-and-audio.md` (`footage()`, transcoding, continuity across a cut, fonts, audio), `references/confetti.md` (`components/confetti.ts`: a seeded burst from a number's edges), `references/piles.md` (`components/pile.ts`: many identical objects heaping up), `references/outline.md` (`components/outline.ts`: a resizable rounded-rectangle outline with gaps, a draw-on and a colour sweep).

## When to use

- A scene shows a logo, screenshot, photo, product image or screen recording.
- An owner skill says to `save-asset` something and then put it on screen.
- Frames render with blank, black or stretched planes where an image or video should be.
- Type needs a specific font, or a scene needs sound.
- A land frame needs confetti (a milestone's number, a launch's reveal).
- Many identical objects gather into a mass (coins into a jar, items onto a floor, a crowd arriving).
- A border, frame or boundary must resize, open a gap, or change colour along its path, or a thin line must stay readable when it scales down.

Not for: finding or generating material (`stock-and-broll`, `screen-capture`), editing user footage into a cut (`video-editing`), type layout (`three-type`), sound levels (`sound-design`).

## Getting files in

1. **Never hot-link.** A remote URL in scene code rots or gets blocked by the renderer. `save-asset` the file into `assets/` first. For a real brand mark, find the official file (the brand's press kit or site); never generate or redraw one. No file at all: the name as a wordmark; a mark the user only described may be built as a flagged stand-in (`brand-sting`'s no-logo policy), never called the logo.
2. **Import it**: `import shotUrl from "../assets/dashboard.png";`. The bundler turns it into a URL (small images become inline data URLs). Add `components/assets.d.ts` once so TypeScript accepts the import (`references/images-and-logos.md` §1).
3. **Load it through `ctx.manager`**: `new THREE.TextureLoader(ctx.manager)`, `new THREE.ImageLoader(ctx.manager)`, or `itemStart`/`itemEnd` around anything else (a font, a video seek).
4. **Name the mesh** after what it shows (`dashboard-screenshot`, `hero-mark`), so the editor can point at it.

## Images and screenshots

- `picture(ctx, url, widthPx, name)`: a plane `widthPx` composition px wide whose height comes from the image's real pixels when it lands, so it is never stretched.
- UI and screenshots are unlit and not tone mapped (`MeshBasicMaterial`, `toneMapped: false`): lit UI looks wrong at once.
- Shown much smaller than its pixels: keep mipmaps and anisotropy 8, or it shimmers as it moves. Shown larger than its pixels: it goes soft; crop and zoom from a bigger source instead.
- A screenshot that fills the frame needs ≥ 1920 px wide (16:9) or ≥ 1080 px (9:16) after crop. Text inside it must clear 28 px where it is shown: zoom into the part that matters rather than shrinking the whole screen.

## Drawn UI (no screenshots)

A product with no screens to show is rebuilt as flat canvas-drawn planes: `references/drawn-ui.md` has `components/ui.ts` (tested) with `screenPanel`, `statusBar`, `field`, `chip`, `button`, `listRow`, `textBars` and `softShadow`, all drawn once at 2× inside `withFonts`, unlit and never tone mapped. Every glyph that is seen clears **28 px on screen** (a panel shown at scale `s` draws its text at ≥ `28 / s`); copy that cannot is grey bars. **Grey bars are for incidental copy only.** When the product's output *is* text (a writing tool, a summariser, a translator, a notes or email app), the words it produces are the proof: set them as real, legible text with the `three-type` kit (≥ 60 px at the payoff, push in rather than shrink), never as bars or as lorem ipsum. Anything that moves on its own (a chip that flies out, a field that fills) is its own plane in the panel's group. Generic chrome in the brand's colours, recorded in `VIDEO.md` as illustrative UI.

## Logos

| Need | Build | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flat mark, any size | `logoPlane(ctx, svgUrl, widthPx, aspect, name)` | The SVG is rasterised at 2× the shown size: crisp at any size |
| 3D mark | `extrudedMark(d, widthPx, depthPx, material, name)` | From the file's path `d` copied verbatim into `components/brand.ts`; bevel 1.2% of width catches the light |
| Mark with gradient fill | Draw the path into a canvas with `Path2D(d)` and the gradient, or extrude and use a face material per tone | The Samsung Pay template draws its marks with `Path2D` |
| Flat mark built from layered facets (a stand-in) | One mesh per facet in one group, `renderOrder` on the meshes; or one Group per layer, each through `onTop(layer, n)` with rising `n` | three.js sorts by the parent Group's `renderOrder` before the mesh's, so an order set on a Group outranks every mesh in other groups (`three-type` `type-kit.md` §4) |
| Lockup (mark + wordmark) | Mark plane + a `three-type` label in the brand font, in one group; gap ≈ 0.25 × the symbol's height (0.75–1 × the cap height), cap height 0.3–0.4 × the symbol | Or the official lockup file as one plane. Move and centre it as one group |

The path parser handles M L H V C S Q T Z, absolute and relative. Arcs throw an error: flatten them in the SVG first, or use the flat plane. Light extruded marks with `three-look`'s product setup and `brand` tone mapping so the brand colour holds.

## Confetti

`references/confetti.md` has `components/confetti.ts` (tested at 1080 × 1080): one `InstancedMesh` of ≤ 300 paper quads (120–180 for a hero land, 10–24 px), each launched from a `hash1` seed, posed in closed form with gravity, linear drag and spin, so any frame renders alone. It spawns on the edges of the box you give it (the number at its punch peak plus its unit line), crowded toward the corners, and aims every piece outward, so none crosses the glyphs for the first 20 f and the burst reads as poppers rather than two columns in the gutters. Pieces live 44–60 f and shrink out; the burst is gone about 2 s after the land. Pass the film's palette as `colors`.

## Piles and crowds

`references/piles.md` has `components/pile.ts` (tested at 1920 × 1080 with 120 coins): one `InstancedMesh` of real items; each has a rest slot computed once (rings per layer, each layer turned by the golden angle, slots jittered and tilted from `hash1`, filled in a hashed order so the surface is ragged) and a land frame from the film's event schedule. Falling is closed-form gravity that lands exactly on its frame, then one damped hop and a settling wobble, so any frame renders alone. `set(frame)` returns how many have landed: drive the counter from it. Never fake a heap with a texture of stacked edges (it reads as a ribbed can, and it snaps on); never leave a few dozen loose items scattered (it reads sparse). The land list is the same one `sound-design`'s many-events stem is built from, so every sound lands on its item.

## Outlines that resize, and lines that survive a scale-down

`references/outline.md` has `components/outline.ts` (tested): a rounded rectangle drawn by a signed-distance shader on one plane, with size, radius, two gaps (a doorway, a notch for a label), a draw-on from any point (one way or both), and a colour sweep along the path, all as per-frame uniforms placed by **perimeter px** so sweeps travel at even speed round the corners. Its stroke is in **screen px**: a 3 px border stays 3 px when it, or the group around it, shrinks into an end card. Lines must stay ≥ 2 px on screen on their smallest frame (thinner lines alias and flicker in the encode); for free-form paths use `three-look`'s line-art stroke with its `uScale` set to the group's scale.

## Device frames

A phone or laptop is an extruded rounded rectangle (glossy dark `MeshPhysicalMaterial`, a small bevel) with the screenshot or footage plane just in front of its face; code in `references/images-and-logos.md` §4. Size the screen to the frame's inner area. Pushing through the screen into the UI is a match-push (`three-camera`, `three-transitions`).

**For a phone with an app working inside it, use `device-mockup`**: the full kit, tested. It builds a convincing generic phone from measured ratios (crisp antialiased ring and bezel at any scale, camera pill, status bar, home indicator, soft two-layer shadow), clips its screens to the rounded glass through a render target, and adds the app kit (sheets, typing inputs, a three-state button, toasts, streaming chat) and the motion on a beat grid. The extruded frame above is for laptops, tablets and a quick 3D prop.

## Footage

- **Transcode first** with `ffmpeg`: VP9 WebM, a keyframe every 15 frames, the project's fps, trimmed to the moment that matters, no audio track. The exact command is in `references/footage-and-audio.md` §1.
- **One helper**: `video-editing`'s `createFootage` (`references/footage-in-scene.md` there) for edits and long clips; `footage(ctx, url, { from, size })` here for short inserts. They are equivalent (pixel-identical in a render test). Both create the element through `ctx.canvas.ownerDocument`, seek it from the frame once per frame, register every seek on `ctx.manager` so the barrier waits for `seeked`, and mark the texture `needsUpdate` when the seek lands.
- **Never `play()`**: wall-clock playback cannot match an export.
- **Across a cut**, one source with agreeing offsets gives consecutive frames: scene N `from = X − D_N / fps`, scene N+1 `from = X`.
- Footage cannot sit inside a motion-blurred scene: the blur accumulates before the seek lands.
- Speed is a function of time: `clip.seek(time * 2)` plays 2×, a constant freezes a frame; a ramp is `clip.seek(s(time))`, where `s` is the closed-form integral of the speed curve.
- Vertical footage in a 16:9 film (or the reverse) sits on a plane at its own aspect with the backdrop around it; never stretch it, and never fill the sides with a blurred copy unless the style family calls for it.

## Fonts

The capture machine has almost no fonts installed, and a new project ships none. `save-asset` the brand's woff2, or Inter's variable woff2 (`three-type`'s Fonts section names sources that work when font CDNs are blocked), into `assets/` and load it with `three-type`'s `withFonts()`, which waits for it inside the frame barrier and only then draws any type.

## Audio

Audio never lives in a scene: an `<audio>` element or Web Audio in scene code is silent in the export. Music, voiceover and effects are files in `assets/` placed on the timeline with `place-audio`, which writes them into `project.json`'s `audio` with a start frame, duration, volume and fades; the render mixes exactly that, and the dev studio plays it under the picture. Levels, fades, ducking and loudness are `sound-design`'s; take a bed's level from its ladder. Footage with its own sound: extract the audio with `ffmpeg`, place it at the picture's start frame and offset, and keep the picture file silent.

## A complete scene: mark and footage

A flat logo, an app recording on a device and its continuation into the next scene; compiled and captured with a WebM test clip (frame-accurate timecodes on both sides of the cut).

```ts
import * as THREE from "three";
import type { ThreeSceneContext, ThreeSceneUpdate } from "@genmotion/three-engine";
import logoUrl from "../assets/logo.svg";
import demoUrl from "../assets/demo.webm";
import { fitCamera, PX } from "../components/stage";
import { colorPipeline, LOOK } from "../components/look";
import { footage } from "../components/media";
import { logoPlane } from "../components/logo";

export default function buildScene(ctx: ThreeSceneContext): ThreeSceneUpdate {
  const { scene, camera, renderer, height, fps, durationInFrames: D } = ctx;
  colorPipeline(renderer, "flat");
  fitCamera(camera, height);
  scene.background = new THREE.Color(LOOK.bg);
  const logo = logoPlane(ctx, logoUrl, 160, 1, "logo");           // 160 px square mark
  logo.position.set(-760 * PX, 420 * PX, 0);
  // the next scene opens on this clip at 3.0 s, so this one ends on 3.0 s minus one frame
  const clip = footage(ctx, demoUrl, { from: 3.0 - D / fps, size: [1920, 1080] });
  const screen = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.PlaneGeometry(12.8, 7.2),  // 1280 x 720 px
    new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: clip.texture, toneMapped: false }));
  screen.name = "demo-recording";
  scene.add(logo, screen);
  return ({ time }) => {
    clip.seek(time);                                              // once per frame, never play()
  };
}
```

## When a frame comes out wrong

| Symptom in a capture | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blank or transparent plane on the first frames | Loader not on `ctx.manager` | `new THREE.TextureLoader(ctx.manager)`; `itemStart`/`itemEnd` around anything custom |
| Footage plane black | H.264 MP4 in the CLI renderer, or the file failed to load | Transcode to VP9 WebM; check the path |
| Footage frames stale or repeating | Texture not updated on `seeked`, or a seek not on `ctx.manager` | One of the two helpers as written |
| Footage one frame behind | Seek on an exact frame boundary | `footage()`'s quarter-frame offset; source at the project fps |
| Image stretched | Plane aspect guessed | `picture()` takes the aspect from the pixels |
| Logo soft | SVG rasterised small, then scaled | `logoPlane()` at the shown width |
| Logo colour shifted | Lit or tone mapped | Flat: `toneMapped: false`; 3D: `brand` tone mapping (`three-look`) |
| Wrong font in the export | Font named, not shipped | `withFonts()` with the woff2 in `assets/` (`three-type`) |
| Silence in the export | Sound in scene code | `place-audio` |
| Confetti in two thin columns, or over the number | Launched from two points, or spawned inside the type | `confetti()` with `box` around everything being read |

## Before building with assets

1. List every file the film needs (marks, screenshots, recordings, fonts, music, VO) in VIDEO.md, with where each comes from.
2. `save-asset` every remote file into `assets/`; note pixel sizes, durations and the mark's viewBox.
3. Transcode footage to WebM at the project fps and trim it; extract its audio if it has any.
4. Add `components/assets.d.ts`, `components/media.ts`, `components/logo.ts`, `components/ui.ts` if the UI is drawn, and the brand path data in `components/brand.ts`.
5. Build; capture the first frame each asset appears.

## Anti-patterns

- **A loader without `ctx.manager`** (or `new Image()`): frames that finish first ship blank.
- **A hot-linked URL or a logo CDN** in scene code.
- **A redrawn, traced or generated brand mark.** Use the official file, verbatim.
- **Stretched screenshots** from a guessed aspect.
- **H.264 MP4 footage, `play()`, or seeks outside `ctx.manager`**: black or stale frames in the export.
- **A second footage helper of your own**: use one of the two tested ones.
- **Sound in a scene.**
- **4K+ textures everywhere**: every frame is rendered and screenshotted; export time multiplies.

## Requirements

| Need | What | Fallback when it is missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Remote files and fonts | `save-asset` | Ask the user to drop the files into `assets/` |
| Transcoding and trimming footage, extracting its audio | `ffmpeg` | Ask for a WebM export of the clip; never ship MP4 into a scene |
| Music, narration, effects | `place-audio` | None: audio outside the manifest is silent in the export |
| Seeing it loaded | `capture-frames` | None |

## Checks before you finish

1. `capture-frames` on the first frame each asset appears, and on the first frame of each scene: no blank, black or stretched planes; footage shows the right moment (compare a timecode or a recognisable frame).
2. Every loader takes `ctx.manager`; every video is seeked (no `play()`), is WebM, and is seeked once per frame.
3. No `http` URL in any scene or component file; every mark comes from an official file in `assets/`, or is the name set as a wordmark, or is a stand-in flagged in `VIDEO.md`.
4. Logos, screenshots and drawn UI are crisp at their largest on-screen size; text inside screenshots and drawn UI clears 28 px on screen in the widest shot that shows it.
5. Every sound is on the timeline in `project.json`, none in scene code.
6. A pile or crowd: `capture-frames` at its first land, mid-fill and full: single items visibly fall and settle, the surface is ragged, and a 100% crop of the full heap shows no rows, rings or stripes; the counter beside it equals the landed count. Every outline or thin line is ≥ 2 px on screen on its smallest frame (crop and look). If the product's output is text, the payoff frame shows that text legible at ≥ 60 px, not bars.
7. Confetti, when there is any: `capture-frames` at land, +2, +10 and +20 shows no piece over the number or its label, and land +65 shows none left.
8. No randomness or wall-clock timing; `validate` passes.

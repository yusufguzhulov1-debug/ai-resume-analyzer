# Video editing: the user's own footage

The user brings footage; you bring the editor's judgement. The work splits in two on purpose: **ffmpeg does the editorial** (what is kept, in what order, at what size, sounding how) and produces one conformed picture file plus one clean dialogue file; **the project does the motion layer** (captions, titles, lower thirds, b-roll, punch-ins, transitions, end card) on top of it. Then you render and measure. Every frame count below is at 30 fps unless it says otherwise; a 24 fps project (most film and cinema-style footage) multiplies frame counts by 0.8 and keeps every time in seconds as it is. Edited footage has no style family (`direction`): the footage is the look, and the format's reference file sets the graphics.

> **These are references, not rules.** The numbers, beat sheets, style families and examples here are starting points distilled from work that landed well, not a recipe to fill in. The user's instructions always win over anything in this skill. When a different idea serves the brief better, propose it and try it: change the structure, break a default, invent a device, and write what you changed and why in `VIDEO.md`. What stays fixed is correctness: determinism, legibility and safe zones, loudness and clipping, licences and credits, never putting words in a real person's mouth, and the sound bans in `sound-design` (no whoosh; never a synthesised noise bed, room tone or "air", which reads as wind or hiss on phones). The checks at the end are a quality bar to clear, not a template to reproduce.

## When to use

- The user supplies camera footage or a recorded conversation and wants it edited: "edit my podcast into clips", "cut a trailer from this footage", "turn my talking head video into a TikTok", "remove the ums", "add captions to my clip", "make Shorts from my long video".
- Formats owned here, each with a reference file: podcast episode and clips, talking head (YouTube long-form, Shorts/Reels/TikTok, LinkedIn, course/tutorial, green-screen reaction), trailer or teaser, launch cut from founder and product footage, Gen Z / TikTok-native edit.

Not this skill:

- **Only a screen recording** and the video is an ad, a store preview or a product tour: `ugc-screen-demo`, `app-store-preview` or `demo-walkthrough` own it. Tie-breaker: if a person on camera (or a podcast/voice track the user recorded) carries the video, it is yours, and you load `screen-capture` for the screen parts; if the screen carries it and narration is generated, it is theirs.
- **No footage at all** (a launch film from screenshots, an explainer from a brief): the router's other owners. Generated presenters belong to `ai-presenter`.
- A UGC ad *concept* to be shot or generated: the `ugc-*` owners. If the creator's footage already exists and needs cutting, it is yours; borrow hooks from `ugc-hooks` and run `ad-qa` at the end.

Read `direction` first (it decides proposition, audience, energy curve and sound on/off). This skill states only what editing changes.

## Ask first (only what the request and the files don't answer)

1. Where it will be posted (YouTube, TikTok/Reels/Shorts, LinkedIn, a podcast feed): this fixes aspect, length, captions and loudness.
2. Target length, or how many clips.
3. Style: clean and professional, or fast and TikTok-native.

If the user says "just do it", default from the table in Step 2 and say what you chose. One exception: captions (or a hook from the speaker's words) with no way to get the words; Step 3 says what to ask and what to deliver.

## The pipeline, and why it is shaped this way

```
footage ─► ffmpeg: probe ► proxy ► transcript/silence map ► paper edit ► cut list
                 ► reframe ► audio cleanup ► conform ─► assets/edit.webm + assets/edit-audio.wav
project:  scenes show edit.webm frame-accurately + captions, titles, b-roll, zooms, end card
timeline: edit-audio.wav (lane 0) + music bed (lane 1) + sfx (lanes 2–3) via `place-audio`
render ─► measure (frames at cuts, caption timing, loudness, duration) ─► deliver
```

Facts this rests on, measured on this product's renderer (read `references/footage-in-scene.md` before writing the first footage scene):

- **Conform every picture file to VP9 WebM** (`libvpx-vp9`, keyframe every 15 frames, project fps). The CLI renders with Playwright's open-source Chromium, which cannot decode H.264 or AAC: a phone's `.mp4` in a scene renders as a black plate while the render still reports success. The desktop app exports in Electron, whose Chromium normally does decode H.264, so the same file can look fine there and black from the CLI; VP9 renders the same on both.
- **Dense keyframes keep seeks exact and fast.** Measured on a 10 s 1080p clip: `-g 15` gave 300 of 300 frames exact; a 240-frame GOP gave 299 of 300 and was twice as slow; all-intra (`-g 1`) was exact but slower and about 2× the file size.
- **On Three.js, register every seek with `ctx.manager`.** The export's frame barrier waits only on the loading manager. A `<video>` seeked by setting `currentTime` alone exported 0 of 300 frames correctly (every frame 1–2 source frames late, frame 0 black). With the seek registered and released on `seeked`, 300 of 300 matched. The reference has the tested helper (a `VideoTexture` marked `needsUpdate` on `seeked`; `three-assets`' canvas-copy `footage()` was re-tested as pixel-identical, so either works).
- **Give edit.webm a 0.5 s tail handle** (`tpad`), or the last frame of the scene shows the second-to-last source frame.
- **Footage is costly to render**: about 10–15 s of render per second of 1080p footage with 4 tabs on the default SwiftShader WebGL, on an idle 4-core machine; 2–3× that on a loaded one (a 41 s Short took 28–35 min). A 20-minute episode is hours. For long-form, use the hybrid path in Step 10. Tell the user the estimate before a long render.
- Video in a scene is always muted. **Sound only exists on the timeline**: the edit's audio is a WAV on lane 0.

## Step 1: intake (probe everything, log it)

Copy every file into `assets/source/` with `save-asset` (never edit originals). For each file run the probe in `references/ffmpeg-recipes.md` §1 and log it in `VIDEO.md`:

```markdown
## Footage log
| File | Dur | Size | fps (r/avg) | Codec | Audio | Notes |
| cam-a.mp4 | 41:12 | 3840×2160 | 29.97/29.97 | hevc | 48k stereo | host, locked off, face x≈1310 |
| phone.mov | 0:58 | 1080×1920 | 30/28.4 VFR | h264 | 44.1k mono | rotate 90, conform CFR first |
```

- VFR (`r_frame_rate` ≠ `avg_frame_rate`) is converted to CFR at the project fps before anything else, or audio drifts.
- **Choose the project fps from the source, and write why in `VIDEO.md`.** 23.976/24 fps footage (cinema-style, many YouTube interviews): project at **24**. Conforming it to 30 repeats every fourth frame (visible judder on pans), and 24 renders 20% fewer frames; scale this pack's 30 fps frame numbers by 0.8. 25 → 25. 29.97/30 → 30. Conform to 30 only when the edit is mostly designed motion over a little footage, and say so. Either way, conform with the per-segment exact-frame graph (recipes §5).
- Make a 540p proxy with `-g 15` and a contact sheet (one tile per 10 s, recipes §2) and **look at it with your own eyes** before cutting. Never edit footage you have not seen. For a conversation, also make the 1 fps talk sheet (recipes §2) of the stretch you are mining.
- Measure the **active picture** with `cropdetect` (recipes §2): letterbox bars and burned-in logo strips are not picture, and every crop and enlargement figure is computed from what is left. Log it ("active 1280×544 at y 88").
- Check the source's first and last 3 s for fades, black and title cards (recipes §2); an out point inside the source's own fade ends the clip on a dimming frame.
- Separate audio recorders: find the offset (clap or cross-correlation, recipes §9) and write it in the log.

## Step 2: choose the format

Pick one row, then read its reference file. Numbers are defaults; the reference file explains when to break them.

| Format | Reference | Length | Visual change every | Gaps kept | Captions | Loudness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Podcast, full episode | `references/podcast.md` | as recorded, tightened | camera hold 4–10 s, wide every 30–90 s | pauses >0.7 s → 0.25–0.4 s | SRT sidecar | −16 LUFS, −1 dBTP |
| Podcast clips (9:16) | `references/podcast.md` | 30–60 s (≤90) | 2–4 s | join ≈0.13 s | burned, word-timed | −14 LUFS |
| YouTube talking head | `references/talking-head.md` | 8–15 min | jump cut 3–8 s, b-roll every 10–30 s | join ≈0.2 s | SRT sidecar | −14 LUFS |
| Shorts / Reels / TikTok | `references/talking-head.md` | 20–45 s (≤60) | 1–3 s, varied | join ≈0.08 s | burned, 1–3 words | −14 LUFS |
| LinkedIn | `references/talking-head.md` | 30–90 s | 4–8 s | join ≈0.2 s | burned sentence case + SRT | −14 LUFS |
| Course / tutorial | `references/talking-head.md` | 3–10 min per lesson | follow the action, 5–20 s | never cut a step | SRT | −16 to −14 LUFS |
| Trailer / teaser | `references/trailer.md` | teaser 30–90 s, trailer 1:30–2:30 | ASL 2–5 s → 8–14 f (24 fps) in the climax | designed silence (the footage's own recorded room tone) | title cards; film subtitles if dialogue is subtitled | −14 LUFS |
| Launch cut | `references/launch-cut.md` | 60–120 s (crowdfunding 1:30–3:00) | 1–3 s on music, hero 3–6 s | join ≈0.13 s | burned on social cutdowns | −14 LUFS |
| Gen Z / TikTok-native | `references/genz.md` | 15–45 s | 0.7–2 s, varied; interrupt every 2–4 s | join ≈0.08 s | burned, caps, 1–3 words | −14 LUFS |

"Gaps kept" is the silence left at a join; the pads that produce it and which pauses get cut at all are the pause table in Step 5.

Write the chosen row into `VIDEO.md` front matter (`skill: video-editing`, `format:`, `aspect:`, `length:`).

## Step 3: transcript or silence map

- With `transcribe`: extract 16 kHz mono (recipes §3), get **word-level** timestamps, and save them as `edit/words.json` (`[{ "w": "Nobody", "s": 12.41, "e": 12.66 }]`). Whisper drops "um/uh" unless prompted; the reference shows the prompt. Word times can be off by 100–300 ms, so pad cuts and snap to low-energy points.
- Find shots: scene detection and a contact sheet per shot change (recipes §2).

**No `transcribe` on this surface: the policy.** Words drive captions, the hook and the choice of moment, so get them before settling for less, in this order:

1. **A local Whisper.** If the shell has `whisper`, `whisper-cli` (whisper.cpp) or the `faster-whisper` Python package, use it. If none is installed, ask the user once for the go-ahead to install one (`pip install faster-whisper` with the `small.en` or `base.en` model, or whisper.cpp with `ggml-base.en.bin`): a one-time install plus a model download of 75–500 MB, then roughly real time on 4 CPU cores. If the network blocks the model download, say so.
2. **A connected speech-to-text service:** ElevenLabs' connector transcribes; offer it with `recommend-integration`.
3. **The user's own transcript or subtitle file** (an SRT, the platform's auto-captions export, a doc with the words).
4. **None of these, and the brief needs captions:** ask once, even after "just make it" (the router's no-questions default does not cover inventing words). One message: what is blocked (captions, a hook from the speaker's words, choosing the best moment by meaning) and the three ways to unblock it.
5. **The user still says go, or cannot answer:** make a clearly marked **no-captions draft**:
   - **The first line of your reply says so**: "Draft without captions: no speech-to-text was available. Send a transcript or SRT, or allow a local Whisper install, and I'll add them." Name the file `<name>-nocaptions.mp4` and record it in `VIDEO.md`.
   - **Never invent caption words**, never paraphrase what you have not heard.
   - **Never lay out the frame around captions that are not there**: no empty lower band held for them. For a single speaker at 720p, 9:16: the plate from y 450 down at up to 2.0× (crop shifts as the step), the crop chosen so the eyes land at y 600–800, nothing load-bearing below y 1450, and the bands under the platform UI never pure white (`references/ffmpeg-recipes.md` §6 has the command and the luma check).
   - **A hook title built only from public facts** (the title, the speaker's identity, the show), as a question or a POV, never a quote (`references/podcast.md`, `references/genz.md`). In a feed draft it stays on screen for the whole film as a **persistent header** (y 270–450, ≤2 lines): it is the only line a muted viewer can read.
   - **A wordless cue at least every 6–8 s** on top of the picture steps (a gesture emoji pop, a freeze + shutter, a speed ramp across a pause, a second identity or topic pop: `references/genz.md`, The no-captions draft). No b-roll: without words nothing can be literal to them.
   - **The peak is provisional**: on the loudest onset, marked as such in `VIDEO.md`.
   - **Prefer one continuous excerpt** over splicing sections you have not heard, chosen by the no-transcript method in `references/podcast.md` (question → answer units, not shots), and call the choice provisional.
   - Wire the caption layer with an empty word list, so the transcript drops in later without a rebuild.

The silence map (`silencedetect`, recipes §4) still gives cut points and pause tightening without words; it gives no meaning, no speaker identity on a mixed track, and on an already-tight source almost nothing to remove.

## Step 4: paper edit (decide the story in text first)

Read the whole transcript before choosing anything. Then write the selects into `VIDEO.md`:

```markdown
## Paper edit
| # | Src | In | Out | First … last words | Role | Note |
| 1 | cam-a | 00:12:04.20 | 00:12:19.80 | "Nobody tells you…" … "…that's the trap." | hook | cold open, pulled forward |
| 2 | cam-a | 00:03:10.00 | 00:03:41.50 | "So I'd raised…" … "…out of cash." | setup | [BROLL: bank statement] |
```

- **Boundaries are thoughts, not shots.** An excerpt starts on the speaker's first syllable after the question (or after their own previous sentence ends) and ends on a pause of ≥0.5 s after a complete thought. A camera change inside a monologue is not a boundary. Check 2 s of source either side of every in and out (recipes §11); if the same speaker is still talking, move the boundary or say it is a mid-answer excerpt.
- **Shape before trim.** Hook → setup → turns → payoff → out. Reordering is allowed (pulling the punchline forward as a 2–4 s cold open is the classic move). Cut tangents and retakes; keep the last complete take, usually the best.
- **Murch's order decides every close call:** emotion > story > rhythm > eye-trace > screen direction > spatial continuity. Never cut a laugh, a reaction or the pause before a punchline to save time.
- **Ethics, non-negotiable:** never splice words or half-sentences into a statement the speaker did not make, never move a "yes" onto a different question, and never compress a qualified claim into an unqualified one. Tightening is fine; changing meaning is not. If a cut would change meaning, keep the longer version or show the cut (a visible jump or b-roll with the original words).

## Step 5: rough cut (cut list → conform)

Turn the paper edit into a cut list in **seconds**, snapped:

- Pad and merge per the **pause table** below, the pack's one set of join numbers (`references/genz.md`, `references/talking-head.md`, `references/podcast.md` and `ugc-craft`'s breath trim all cite it). Caption grouping has its own pause rule (`ugc-craft`); it is unrelated.

| Format | In pad (before the first word) | Out pad (after the last word) | Join gap left | Pauses that get cut |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gen Z, Shorts / Reels / TikTok, UGC talk | −0.03 s (1 f) | +0.05 s (1–2 f) | ≈0.08 s | between takes: all; inside a continuous monologue: only pauses ≥0.25 s |
| Podcast clips, launch cuts | −0.05 s | +0.08 s | ≈0.13 s | ≥0.25 s |
| Clean talking head (YouTube, LinkedIn, course) | −0.08 s | +0.12 s | ≈0.2 s | ≥0.3–0.5 s, and every flub |
| Podcast, full episode | −0.10 s | +0.15 s | 0.25–0.4 s (compressed, not removed) | only pauses >0.6–0.8 s |
| Trailer / film lines | whole lines, cut where the bed is quietest | | the music decides | none inside a line |

Why ≥0.25 s inside a monologue: a tight speaker's shorter pauses buy 0.1–0.2 s each and cost a jump cut each, which turns the edit into a stutter; cut fewer, and get the density from picture steps (Step 6). The pads assume word times checked against the waveform: Whisper's can be 100–300 ms off, so snap each boundary to the nearest low-energy point first; on a silence map, pad from the silence edges.
- Round every boundary to the **project** frame: `round(t × fps) / fps`, and give each segment its exact frame count `N = round((out − in) × fps)`.
- 10 ms audio fades at every boundary (no clicks); under dialogue gaps, the footage's own recorded room tone (harvested from its quietest stretch), never digital silence and never a synthesised noise.

Then conform in **one** ffmpeg pass (recipes §5): per segment `trim` → `fps` → exact `N` frames (and `atrim` to `N / fps`), then `concat`, scale, a 0.5 s tail handle, VP9 with `-g 15` to `assets/edit.webm`, and the dialogue to `assets/edit-audio.wav` (48 kHz). Keep the cut list in `edit/cutlist.json` with each segment's source in/out and its new start, so captions and b-roll can be re-timed: `new_t = segment_start + (src_t − in)`.

Confirm `edit.webm` has exactly the **planned** frames + the 0.5 s handle (15 frames at 30 fps, 12 at 24), `edit-audio.wav` is exactly planned frames ÷ fps long, and the cut frames found by a difference scan match the planned segment starts. If not, the cut graph is wrong; fix it now, not after the render. (Applying `fps` once after the concat drifted a 23.976 source by 2 frames at a cut.)

## Step 6: tighten

- Pauses and fillers per the Step 5 pause table. Remove about 60–80% of isolated um/uh, not all of them: removing every one sounds robotic and causes pitch jumps.
- Two consecutive segments of the same camera need a visible framing change or b-roll over the join; otherwise the cut reads as a mistake. Two steps qualify: `ugc-craft`'s **jump zoom** (scale 1.0 → 1.2 on the cut frame and back to 1.0 on the next, never two zoomed segments in a row), or a **crop shift** of 80–120 output px left or right with no size change. The jump zoom multiplies the enlargement, the crop shift does not, so **base × step ≤ 2.0** (Step 7) decides: from a single 720p angle the crop shift is the workhorse (base up to 2.0), or a 1.2 jump zoom on a base of at most 1.66. A 6–8% size step alone reads as a twitch; pair it with a crop shift.
- **Feed formats need more changes than the speech has pauses.** Add picture-only steps on word onsets inside a continuous take (a hard step, no ease) until no stretch exceeds 2.5 s without a visual change, and **vary the rhythm**: fast runs (2–3 changes 0.5–1 s apart) around the lines that matter, 2–2.5 s holds on lines that need reading, at least 3 kinds of change (size step, crop shift, speed ramp, freeze, text pop). The hook gets ≥2 events in its first 3 s, the first by 1.0 s. A step every 2.0 s for 35 s is a metronome even though it never breaks the ceiling (`references/genz.md`, Density; the check is in recipes §11).
- Cut on action where you can (a head turn, a gesture); cut on a blink rather than mid-word.
- J- and L-cuts on dialogue transitions and every b-roll in/out: audio leads or trails the picture by 6–24 frames.

## Step 7: reframe

- Fixed framing (one crop per camera, the common podcast case): crop in ffmpeg during the conform (recipes §6), eyes on the upper-third line (y ≈ 1/3 of height), lead room in the direction of gaze.
- Moving framing (speaker switches, eased reframes, zoom moves): conform at the source aspect and move the footage plate in the scene, where easing is a one-liner.
- Two people in one wide shot for 9:16: stacked split screen (two 1080×960 halves) for exchanges; active-speaker crop for monologues; blurred letterbox only as a last resort. Use every angle the source has of the speaker, including a crop of the wide.
- **Enlargement limit:** total enlargement of source pixels, `base × step` (the reframe's scale times any jump zoom or punch-in, measured from the active picture), **≤2.0×, ≤1.3× ideal**. A full-height 9:16 crop of 720p is already 2.67× (3.5× from a 544 px letterboxed picture), so sources ≤720p or letterboxed take a different layout: stacked angles (1.33× from 720p), a 4:5 or 1:1 plate with the hook above it (base 1.875–2.0, so crop shifts, not size steps), the no-captions plate from y 450 (Step 3), or the 16:9 picture whole on a blurred fill as the last resort (recipes §6 has the table, the commands and the arithmetic). Compute the worst case before choosing and log it.
- **Sharpen anything above 1.3×**, mildly: `unsharp=5:5:0.5` in the conform's scale chain (0.4–0.6; 0.8+ halos). If you accept more softness than the limit, name it in the delivery note.
- **Bands outside the plate sit under platform UI** (white text): never pure white there; keep their mean luma under ~240 (a 0–35% gradient scrim, grey, a dark canvas, or the plate anchored to the bottom edge). Matching the canvas to a white wall hides the plate edge but needs the scrim.
- **Fetch the highest rendition before you reframe.** Enlargement is computed from the pixels you have, so a 1080p download of a film that exists in 4K costs you the layout. When the source is a streaming manifest (DASH `.mpd`, HLS `.m3u8`) or a page offering several sizes, list every rendition with `ffprobe` and take the tallest the licence allows (recipes §6, Source rendition); ask the user for the master when they own the film. Then compute the base each aspect needs and log it: full-height 9:16 base = 1920 ÷ active height (818 px → 2.35×, 1090 px → 1.76×, 1636–1744 px → 1.10–1.17×).
- **Keep a scope picture letterboxed in 16:9** (2.39–2.40:1): never enlarge it to fill.
- **Scope (2.35–2.40:1) into 9:16**, in this order (recipes §6, the scope row):
  1. **Full-height 9:16 crop on every shot** when the active height gives base ≤1.3 (a 4K master: ≤2.0 also passes). No bands at all; this is the layout a trailer house ships.
  2. **Too few rows for that** (an ~800 px scope picture): close-ups full-height (faces and clean CG tolerate up to 2.35× sharpened; name it in the delivery note), wides inside a 4:5 window (1.65× from 818 px) whose bands carry the cards, subtitles and title. Never one constant letterboxed window on every shot: that leaves ~30% of the frame dead black and reads as a reposted landscape video.
  3. **Reframe per shot, keyed to the subject.** A static or single-eased crop loses a subject that moves across a scope frame. Give each moving shot 2–4 keys `[frame, cx]` (monotone between keys, following the subject's centre, never past it), in the conform as a crop expression or in the scene as a keyed plate (`references/footage-in-scene.md`, Keyed reframe).
  4. **Check the subject is in the window on every 4th frame** of every moving shot (recipes §6, the strip): the subject's head and the action's point of contact are inside the crop on every tile. The hook shot and the climax's peak shot first: a clipped heroine at the peak is the costliest framing fault.

## Step 8: the motion layer

Graphics serve the footage; they never cover a face or the active speaker's mouth.

| Element | Spec | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| Captions | social spec per `ugc-craft`; placements, word timing and the Three.js build in `references/captions.md` | each word from its start frame |
| Hook title (social) | 5–9 words, just below the top band (y 270–450 of 1920) | first 3–5 s, or persistent |
| Lower third (16:9 and 1:1 only) | name + role, first appearance only. In 9:16 it fights the caption band: name the speaker with a ≥60 px text pop in the hook or caption band instead | in 12–16 f, hold 4–6 s, out 6–9 f |
| Chapter / topic card | 3–7 words | 1–2 s |
| Keyword pop | 2–5 words | 1.5–3 s |
| B-roll insert | literal to the words, from the user, `stock-and-broll`, or `screen-capture` | 2–5 s, every 10–30 s long-form, 1–3 s social |
| Zoom moves | `ugc-craft`'s named moves: jump zoom 1.0 ↔ 1.2 on cuts; punch-in 1.0 → 1.12 over 8 f inCubic on a stressed word (≤4 per 30 s); long-form only: a slow push 1.0 → 1.08 over 3–6 s for a serious line | jump zoom per Step 6 |
| End card | CTA with URL or handle | social ≤2 s (or loop); YouTube 10–20 s end-screen area |

Entrances, exits, easing and overshoot come from `motion-language` (text 12 f per word, exits ~0.6× the entrance, holds ≥18 f before an exit). Default to hard cuts between footage segments; dissolves mean time passing; flashier transitions belong only to Gen Z and trailer styles.

**Building it, per engine:**

- **Three.js (default):** one scene per section (each ≤18,000 frames), each showing `edit.webm` from its own `SOURCE_IN` through the tested footage helper in `references/footage-in-scene.md`: an orthographic camera, a full-frame plate, captions as canvas-texture word meshes (`references/captions.md`), titles per `three-type`, scene handoffs per `three-transitions`. Load fonts per `three-type`; a missing font falls back silently.
- **HyperFrames:** `<video src="assets/edit.webm" muted playsinline data-start data-duration data-media-start>` in each sub-composition (timing on the video or its wrapper, never both; never `play()` or seek it yourself), the dialogue as a separate `<audio>`; captions and graphics are HTML over it, animated on the scene's paused timeline.
- **React (older projects):** `<Video src={clip} startFrom={seconds} />` from `@genmotion/motion`, which awaits its own seeks; captions with `<TextAnimation>` or per-word spans driven by the word list.

## Step 9: sound

Hand the mix to `sound-design`; it owns levels (its bed row is the one bed level), ducking, music sourcing, placeholder SFX and loudness. Editing-specific rules:

- **A clean dialogue track** (a lav or a podcast mic): clean it before it goes on the timeline, in this order: high-pass 80–100 Hz → gentle denoise → cut 200–400 Hz by 2–4 dB → compress 3:1 (3–6 dB of gain reduction) → de-ess → normalise (recipes §7). Over-denoising sounds underwater; stop early.
- **A finished mix, no stems** (a film, a published video, a broadcast: dialogue, music and effects in one track): **no denoise chain**, which eats the score and the room. Instead:
  - pick lines whose bed is quiet (a gap in the score, a held chord), and cut their handles where the bed is quietest;
  - lift a line with two cascaded 120–150 Hz high-passes, +3 dB at ~3 kHz, gain ≤ +6–8 dB, 40–80 ms fades at the handles (recipes §7, Lifting a line);
  - measure the speech band (300–3400 Hz) RMS against the band below 250 Hz: if the low band wins, filter harder or choose another line. A flat gain lifts the score's low end with the voice and turns a whisper into a slab;
  - a cold-open line sits 6–10 LU under Act 1's music, not above it (measure each section, recipes §11);
  - ask once for stems or an M&E (music and effects) mix if the user may have them: with a clean dialogue stem none of this is needed.
- **Headroom before SFX**: when sound effects sit on top of speech or music, pre-master the dialogue (or the music bed) to **−15 LUFS / −3 dBTP**, not −14 / −1.5, and expect the AAC encode to add up to ~1 dB of true peak; then the export's two-pass re-master is the standard last step (`sound-design`, Headroom and loudness).
- Place `edit-audio.wav` on lane 0 at volume 1 from frame 0 with `place-audio`. A clip may be at most 18,000 frames (10 min at 30 fps): split longer dialogue into consecutive entries, each with `startFrom` (seconds) where the last one ended.
- **Over speech** (talking head, podcast clip, a Gen Z edit of someone talking): the speech decides the cuts; a bed, if any, sits on `sound-design`'s bed row (0.12–0.2 after both are normalised, 14–20 LU under the voice; a busy track low-passed at 6–8 kHz). Podcast and LinkedIn often take none. Drop it out under the single most important line.
- **Music-led** (trailers, a Gen Z montage without talk): pick the track first, then cut to it (`sound-design` beat grid; on a score with no steady pulse, phrases and swells, `references/trailer.md`). Shape a trailer's loudness as a staircase with volume automation and peak limiting, never `loudnorm` on the whole cue, which flattens the build (`sound-design`). The timeline has 4 lanes and one static volume per clip, so a trailer mix with many overlapping pieces and automated levels (bed, lines, hits, sync sound, room tone) is **pre-mixed in one ffmpeg graph to one WAV** and placed at 1.0 (`references/trailer.md`, Sound design).
- No `sfx` on this surface: `sound-design`'s synthesised placeholders, labelled as such, beat a Gen Z edit with no sound design.

## Step 10: render

- Validate every scene (`validate`), then `capture-frames` at the first frame, one frame after each cut, and the busiest caption moment.
- Short-form: render the whole thing.
- Long-form (over ~5 minutes of footage): the hybrid path. ffmpeg finishes the body from the cut list (punch-ins, crops, simple lower thirds with `drawtext`); the project renders only the designed inserts (cold-open title, chapter cards, end card) at the same size and fps; ffmpeg concatenates them with the body (recipes §10), and captions ship as an SRT sidecar, which is what YouTube and podcast platforms want anyway. Or render everything in the project if the user accepts the render time; tell them the estimate.

## Step 11: measure

All with `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` (recipes §11):

1. **Duration** equals total frames ÷ fps, and the first frame is not black, a blink, mid-word or inside a camera move.
2. **Look at the whole export at once**: the contact sheet in recipes §11 (2 tiles a second, frame numbers burned in).
3. **Frames at cuts:** extract the frame at every cut and one frame either side; look at them. For an exact check, compare the export to `edit.webm` with `psnr` over a band no graphic covers: runs of low values or a dip every Nth frame mean the footage is late; one isolated dip is encoder noise.
4. **Caption timing:** at three random words, the frame at the word's start shows that word highlighted, and nothing sits in the platform's UI zones.
5. **Unintended gaps:** `silencedetect` on the export finds no silence over 1 s you did not design.
6. **Visual-change density** (feed formats): with the threshold calibrated on two planned cut frames (0.6× the smaller difference, recipes §11), the cut scan plus your designed event frames leave no gap over 2.5 s, and the interval report shows a varied rhythm (spread ≥2×, sd/mean ≥0.35, ≥20% of intervals ≤1.2 s) with the first event by 1.0 s. A trailer's title hold (2–3 s) and end card are exempt; its other cards are not (shorten them or lay them over picture, `references/trailer.md`).
7. **Boundaries:** speech: 2 s of source before every in and after every out show no thought being cut (recipes §11). Edits cut from shots (trailer, montage): every segment stays inside one source shot, re-checked after every retime (recipes §11, Segments inside one shot); a segment that runs one frame over a source cut shows a stray frame of the next shot.
8. **Loudness:** `ebur128` integrated within 1 LU of the target, true peak ≤ −1 dBTP. If the true peak is over, re-master the export (`sound-design`: peak-limit, then two-pass linear `loudnorm`, the video copied); if loudness is off by more than 1 LU, scale the clips and render again. For a trailer, also the loudness per section (recipes §11): rising act by act, the climax loudest.

## Step 12: deliver

- The MP4 (H.264 High, yuv420p, AAC 48 kHz, faststart) at the platform's size.
- Sidecars where the format wants them: SRT captions; YouTube chapters (first at 00:00, at least 3, each ≥10 s, 3–7 word titles); podcast chapter metadata.
- For social clips: say which frame makes the best cover, and that trending audio, if wanted, is added in the app.
- Record in `VIDEO.md`: the cut list file, every music/SFX licence, and what you assumed.

## Good and bad

- **Good:** the clip opens on "Nobody tells you that raising money is the easy part" at frame 0, caption already up. **Bad:** it opens on "So, yeah, I think, um, the thing is…" and reaches the hook at 6 s.
- **Good:** two jump-cut segments alternate 1.0 and 1.2 scale, so the join reads as intentional. **Bad:** two 100% segments of the same angle, and the head twitches at the cut.
- **Good:** "We're not profitable yet, but we will be by Q3" stays whole. **Bad:** "We're … profitable" made by deleting the middle. That is fabrication, not editing.
- **Good:** footage conformed to VP9 with `-g 15`, seeks registered, frame-at-cut check passes. **Bad:** the phone's H.264 `.mp4` placed directly in a Three scene: it renders black and the render still says ok.
- **Good:** a 1–3 word caption centred at y 1160 of 1920, inside x 120–840. **Bad:** an eight-word line at y 1750, under TikTok's caption and username UI, running under the action column.

## Requirements

| Need | Capability or skill | Fallback when missing |
|---|---|---|
| Cutting, conforming, measuring | `ffmpeg` | None for footage edits: ask the user to install it (`genmotion doctor` shows the bundled one) |
| Word timestamps | `transcribe` | A local Whisper (with the user's go-ahead to install), the ElevenLabs connector, or the user's transcript/SRT; else ask once even after "just make it", and if told to go on, a marked no-captions draft per Step 3. Never invented words |
| Footage, b-roll, music into assets | `save-asset` | Ask the user to drop files into `assets/source/` |
| Timeline audio | `place-audio` | None: audio not on the timeline is silent in the export |
| Seeing frames | `capture-frames` | Render a short `--frames` range and extract stills with `ffmpeg` |
| Scene checks | `validate` | Render a few frames and look |
| Music | `music` | The user's own track, or no music (talk carries it) |
| Sound effects | `sfx` | User-supplied files, credited CC0 sounds, or `sound-design`'s synthesised placeholders (labelled) |
| Direction, motion, mix | `direction`, `motion-language`, `sound-design` | None: read them |
| B-roll and stock | `stock-and-broll` | The user's own cutaways, or punch-ins instead |
| Three.js build | `three-type`, `three-assets`, `three-transitions` | None on a Three project |

## Checks before you finish

- [ ] Every source file is probed and logged in `VIDEO.md` (active picture, fps, head/tail fades); VFR sources were conformed to CFR; the project fps and why are recorded.
- [ ] Captions required and no words available: the user was asked once; any delivery without captions is named `*-nocaptions`, says so in the reply's first line, keeps a public-facts hook as a persistent header, has a wordless cue at least every 6–8 s, and no empty caption band.
- [ ] The paper edit is in `VIDEO.md`, and no cut changes what a speaker said or meant.
- [ ] `edit.webm` is VP9 with keyframes every 15 frames, at the project fps, with a 0.5 s tail handle; its frame count is the planned total + the 0.5 s handle, `edit-audio.wav` is planned frames ÷ fps long, and its cut frames match the plan.
- [ ] Every excerpt's in and out sit on complete thoughts (2 s source check either side), or the delivery note says it is mid-answer.
- [ ] Frame 0 of the export already shows the hook (social) or the cold open (long-form); it is not black.
- [ ] The frame at every cut and one frame after it show the intended source frame (looked at, or `psnr` band check clean).
- [ ] No two adjacent segments of one angle at the same framing without b-roll over the join (a ≥20% size step or an 80–120 px crop shift).
- [ ] Total enlargement `base × step` ≤2.0× everywhere (worst shot computed and logged), sharpened above 1.3×; no band under the platform UI is pure white (mean luma <240).
- [ ] Reframed sources: the tallest available rendition was used (or the reason not is logged); scope into 9:16 is full-height where the rows allow, never one constant letterboxed window; every moving shot's every-4th-frame strip keeps the subject inside the crop.
- [ ] Shot-cut edits: the per-segment scene check finds no source cut inside any segment after the last retime.
- [ ] Feed formats: with the calibrated threshold the density check prints no gap over 2.5 s, the rhythm varies (spread ≥2×, sd/mean ≥0.35), and the first visual event is by 1.0 s.
- [ ] Captions: at three sampled words the highlighted word matches the audio frame; lines fit the safe zone for the platform; reading rate within `references/captions.md`.
- [ ] No graphic covers a face; lower thirds only on first appearance, and none in 9:16 Gen Z / Shorts edits.
- [ ] `silencedetect` finds no unintended gap over 1 s; there are no clicks at cuts (10 ms fades); joins follow the Step 5 pause table for the format; any designed silence is the footage's own recorded room tone (−45 to −60 dBFS RMS) or a decayed tail, never a synthesised noise.
- [ ] Finished-mix sources: no denoise chain on them; every lifted line's speech band beats its low band.
- [ ] Any bed sits on `sound-design`'s bed row (14–20 LU under the voice); placeholder SFX are labelled.
- [ ] Integrated loudness within 1 LU of the format's target, true peak ≤ −1 dBTP.
- [ ] Music and SFX licences, the cut list path and your assumptions are recorded in `VIDEO.md`.

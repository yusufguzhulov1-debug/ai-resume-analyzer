# Style families

The ten looks GenMotion's own templates are built in, measured from their source, plus K, measured from a curated set of social-native launch films (the taste `launch-taste` aims at). Each entry gives what the family is, when to pick it, and its palette, type, motion, pacing, transition and sound signature with numbers (frames at 30 fps). Pick one per film and copy its signature into the Direction block; borrow a single device from a second family only when the idea needs it, and say so.

Moves named here (blurUp, pop, flood, iris, persisting element…) are defined with exact timings in `motion-language`.

These families are *how* a look is built. For launch, feature, brand and milestone films, *which* look to choose is decided by `launch-taste`'s style map (`references/style-map.md` in that skill): it says what each look communicates, which products it suits and fails for, and names the family letter here that supplies the numbers. Where the two seem to differ, the style map decides the choice and this file decides the numbers. Its "dark cinematic minimal" is a ground, not a family: apply it to A, C or G under the brand-colour rule below.

Two rules sit above every row:

- **Type follows the house size table** in `three-type` (the design standards every project carries): hero 72–130 px, supporting 34–48, labels 28–34, uppercase eyebrows 28, nothing under 28 px, headline weight ≤ 500. Some templates were measured heavier or smaller; the rows below are already adjusted, and where anything here seems to differ, the table wins. The only type above 130 px is a single word or number that *is* the image (A's bleed punch word, J's hero number, a brand's wordmark lockup).
- **The owner's pacing wins**: a family gives the look (palette, type, texture, transitions, sound colour); the owner skill's beat sheet and scene lengths decide the tempo.
- **Levels in the Sound rows are what the templates measured**; the mix itself follows `sound-design` (one bed row: 0.1–0.2 under any voice, −14 LUFS master).
- **Brand colours override a family's stage.** On a brand ground keep the family's UI treatment, motion, type and transitions; the brand hex replaces the stage, with any vignette within ±8 L so the hex still reads at the corners (and so a loop's last and first frames sit on the same ground).
- **Edited footage has no family**: the footage is the look; titles and cards follow `video-editing`'s format references.

## A. Beat-cut kinetic type

**What it is**: one idea per card, dead centre, cut on a musical grid. Apple's "Don't Blink" is the archetype. Stillness is the style: cards do not tween.

**Pick it when**: you have copy and a logo and nothing else; the brief is hype; the track has a clear pulse (90–132 BPM).

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | Pure #000 / #fff. At most one accent (a violet like #9b9cff on dark, a royal blue like #1f3fd1 on white). Emphasis cards invert (white ground, black type) |
| Type | One grotesque at 500 (the templates ran 600–700; the house cap is 500). Reading cards in two steps inside 72–130 px, plus a "bleed" size of 580–960 px for the one punch word that is the image. Tracking tightens with size: −0.012em under 100 px, −0.025em above 100, −0.035em for bleed. Line height 0.78 for bleed type, 1.05 otherwise. Tabular figures |
| Motion | No easing at all, or a micro-settle (scale 1.06 → 1 over 12f). Accent cards open with a 2-frame strobe of solid foreground colour. Letters or words can build 2f apart. Two-pass ink: words appear grey, ink 5f later |
| Pacing | Card holds are multiples of an eighth note: at 90 BPM one eighth is 10f, so holds of 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15f; countdown digits 30f. Average about 8f per card. Scenes 70–160f |
| Transitions | The hard cut on the beat *is* the grammar. Chapter separators: cut to black, an 8f fade to black, or an 8f white wipe |
| Sound | One driving track at full level, every cut on its grid. Optional pop per word (−6 dB, 6f clips) and a logo hit |
| Logo hold | Short by design: 10–30f |

**Goes wrong when**: cards don't land on the grid (it feels random instead of musical), or the punch word is not the biggest thing in the film.

## B. Soft-light SaaS

**What it is**: the product's real UI, rebuilt at true proportions and magnified, on a white or creme stage. A cursor drives the story. Shared elements cross cuts. Something always drifts.

**Pick it when**: the material is app or SaaS screens; launch, feature or demo; audience wants to see it working.

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | Bg #fff, #fafafb, #fdfdfd or a creme #F7F4ED. Ink #0a0a0b–#1b1b1b. Muted around #5c5a55–#6b6b73, kept at ≥5:1 contrast. One brand gradient used on one element at a time (a band, the mark, an underline, an emphasis word) |
| Type | A neutral grotesque 400–500. Hero 96–130 px at −0.025 to −0.03em; body 36–38; eyebrow 28 px uppercase at +0.14 to +0.2em |
| Motion | blurUp / riseMask by word (12–14f, stagger 3–4), sometimes with a colour sweep from light to ink. Word-slot flips. Typing at 2–3 frames per character with a real caret. Click = 4f press + 6f release + an 8–14f ring. Camera pushes to 1.7–3.8×. Marks arrive on a gentle spring with no overshoot. Counters 40–120f |
| Pacing | New information every 14–50f; scenes 30–310f, mean about 5 s |
| Transitions | Persisting element, card → full-bleed morph, colour-field push, button flood, iris from the clicked button or the logo, gradient band wipe, scale-matched cut, exit-then-cut |
| Sound | Either a music bed at full level and no effects, or VO at full level over a bed at about −17 dB with clicks on every press |
| Logo hold | 75–120f |

**Goes wrong when**: the UI is a screenshot pasted flat (rebuild and magnify the part that matters), the cursor teleports, or the drift is still running at a matched cut.

**On a brand-colour ground** (a deep green, a navy): keep B's rebuilt UI, magnification, cursor and motion; the brand hex replaces the white stage, and the UI panels stay light so they read as screens.

## C. 3D product hero

**What it is**: everything is a real 3D object (glossy coins, extruded type, phones, light rays). Objects fly out of the lens and slam. Floods of brand colour carry every cut.

**Pick it when**: consumer or fintech product, a physical-feeling object, a Three.js project that should look like Three.js.

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | White or near-black stage + one electric brand colour (a lime like #c8f31d) used only as fills, rays and glows, never small text (it fails 4.5:1 on white) + one punch colour (an electric blue like #1d2bf0) for exactly one word. Extruded type in three tones of the brand colour (face, bevel, side) |
| Type | Grotesque 500. Headlines 110–130 px at −0.03em; a single slammed word or number may go to 150–190 px as the image; eyebrow 28 px at +0.2em |
| Motion | Pop: keys [0 → 1.08 at 60% → 1] over 14f. Slam: z 6 → 0 with scale 0.7 → 1.04 → 1 over 14f. Burst: 25 objects staggered 1–2f, 22–26f ease-out. Rays spin 0.006 rad/frame continuously. Kinetic words 3f apart, entrance 9f, exit 6f |
| Pacing | 18–25f between beats; scenes 33–180f |
| Transitions | Radial colour flood (10–13f, ease-in) that the next scene contracts into an object (a pill, a button); rush into the lens; push into a ring; white wipe; hard cut to black at the very end |
| Sound | Music at −5 dB (0.55). A tap (−2 dB) on the press that starts each flood, never a whoosh (`sound-design`); impact (−3 to −1.4 dB) on slams and the logo; click on taps; coin or pop clusters on bursts |
| Logo hold | 28–90f |

**Calm C** (health, luxury, finance, hardware sold on trust): drop the pop, slam, burst and colour-flood numbers above; keep one material, one light and one slow move, headlines rise and fade with no blur (`motion-language`), and the ground changes once, at the peak, after the object has completed its move.

**Soft-gloss C** (integrations, tokens, apps, consumer fintech; measured on social launch films): many small objects instead of one hero: app-icon squircles and thick-rimmed coins in clearcoat plastic (`three-look` `references/social-looks.md`), rounded bevels of 6–10% of the object's width, one studio environment for all of them. Flights in wide arcs over 30–60f with objects crossing in front of and behind the type; near objects ≥ 20% of frame height and motion-blurred (5 trailing ghosts over half a frame of travel, 0.3 → 0.05 opacity, `three-look` §4 of `references/social-looks.md`), far ones sharp; seeded per-item phase. A swarm escalates in three steps (a few, an orbit, a field) over 3–5 s. Pop on arrival 1 → 1.06 → 1 over 10f. The ground stays one colour or one gradient; no floods between beats.

**Goes wrong when**: the brand colour lands on small text, two colours punch in one frame, or 3D is used as decoration around flat content.

## D. One-shot camera film

**What it is**: a single world and no cuts. Scenes are windows onto one continuous time; the camera moves and circle reveals do the work of transitions.

**Pick it when**: the story is a journey through one space (a desktop, a phone, a map); premium, calm-confident tone.

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | Monochrome (#f2f2f2 and black, hairlines #bdbdbd) or a real wallpaper plus one orange (#ff6a1a) |
| Type | Grotesque 420–500 at −0.025em, about 95 px. Text sits in screen space and shrinks into the world when the camera pulls back |
| Motion | Keyed camera, every move a 1.5–3 s ease-in-out, zoom interpolated in log space so a push feels even. Words arrive 3.6f apart, 24f each, from 170 px right. Real motion blur from sub-frame samples. Film grain |
| Pacing | A big beat every 45–90f; inner text every 3–4f |
| Transitions | None. Circle bursts (white disk to full frame in 11–16f), pull-back / push-in, dashed orbit rings |
| Sound | Either one soundtrack, or literal effects on every event (up to about one per second) over music at −4.4 dB (0.6) |
| Logo hold | 75–120f |

**Goes wrong when**: a move stops dead at an interior key (use a monotone spline through camera keys), or the camera moves in two directions at once.

## E. Chat-UI social

**What it is**: a real chat app, pixel-faithful to the platform's theme, telling a story in messages. Vertical or square.

**Pick it when**: the story is a conversation (a friend's problem, a group chat, an assistant); feed placement; ads.

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | The platform's own (dark: wallpaper #0b141a, incoming #202c33, outgoing #005c4b; light: #fff, incoming #efefef, outgoing a blue-violet gradient). Do not invent chat colours |
| Type | The system UI face, 46/62 px at 1080 wide (36/46 inside a phone frame) |
| Motion | The slot opens 12f before the bubble (ease-out) so nothing reflows. Bubble spring mass 0.8, stiffness 165, damping 17 over 16f, scale 0.8 → 1 from the tail corner. Typing dots run 30–40f before an incoming message. Composer types 2–3 frames per character. Reactions on a bouncier spring (0.6 / 200 / 14, 18f) |
| Pacing | 40–58f between messages (each is read before the next), 20–22f for a "frantic group chat" beat |
| Transitions | None inside the chat, or a camera push through the phone screen (45f, ease-in-out) and a pull back out (52f) |
| Sound | One message sound per bubble on its first visible pixel (−1.4 to −0.9 dB); bed at about −17 dB, or full level with no VO |
| Logo hold | 60–90f end card |

**Goes wrong when**: the bubble's sound fires before it is visible, text sits under the platform's own UI, or messages arrive faster than they can be read.

## F. Whiteboard explainer

**What it is**: hand-drawn strokes on white paper, narrated. Every element draws on along its stroke and erases back at the end of its idea.

**Pick it when**: teaching a concept to a general audience with VO; 30–180 s.

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | Paper #fff, ink #1e1e1e, grey #495057, one red #e03131 for the pen underline and emphasis, a light hatch #ff8787 |
| Type | A hand font scale: 112 / 96 / 48 / 42 / 40 / 32 px + a mono at 34. Single left column at a 140 px margin |
| Motion | Text draws in over clamp(width / 45, 8, 18) frames; strokes 8–20f, ease-out along the path. Text rises 6 px and floats ±1.2 px. Dots overshoot 35% while drawing. Examples 5f apart. A red underline draws 12f after its phrase |
| Pacing | Per scene: tag at 0–2, title at 6, subtitle at 16, diagram 24–60, takeaway 76–124. Scenes 200–240f (about 7 s) |
| Transitions | Board erase: every element reverses its stroke over 10f starting 18f before the end, leaving 8f of blank paper, then a cut onto identical paper |
| Sound | VO starts exactly 6f after each cut; bed at about −13 dB (0.22) |
| Logo hold | 60–90f |

**Goes wrong when**: the camera drift doesn't return to rest at both ends (the cut onto blank paper jumps), or the whole diagram appears before the VO names its parts.

**Text-led (no VO)**: F's timings are VO-timed. Without a voice keep F's look (strokes on paper, or a dark variant: strokes in #ededef on #0b0b0c) and use the text-led clock from `explainer` instead (parts appear with the words that name them, lines held by the hold formula).

## G. Textured tactile

**What it is**: a textured world (paper grain, dither, HUD brackets, pixel grids) with pixel-built transitions and a pulse in the ambience. Two variants: dark retro-tech HUD and warm paper collage.

**Pick it when**: crypto, security, developer tools with attitude, editorial or voice products; a brand that wants grain instead of gloss.

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | HUD: near-black #070605, yellow #ffd23f, loss red #ff4d4f, panel #0d0e10. Paper: #efeeea, ink #111, a dither gradient from blue #1f6db5 to olive #8f9a4a, an orange gradient #e8462b → #f38a2c |
| Type | A tech display face for HUD, or a grotesque 400 at −0.02em for paper (scatter words 96 px) |
| Motion | Pixel-block wipe (12 × 7 cells, 18–24f). Pixel-glitch dissolves 15–21f. Scatter words pop 6f apart in 2-frame pops. Linear paper drift so words are carried off, not faded. Heartbeat halos at 75 BPM (lub, dub 8f later at 0.6 strength). Badges stamp: a 1-frame flash, settle over 4–5f. Block-caret typing at about 12 characters per second |
| Pacing | 25–30f between beats; scenes about 75f median when VO-led (as a look borrowed by a calm owner such as `explainer`, keep the owner's scene lengths) |
| Transitions | Block wipe (cells grow out of an on-screen object of the wipe's colour; the incoming beat is already 12f into its animation when the cells clear, see `three-transitions`), iris to an object, shrink to an avatar, frame → card collapse, fall into dark |
| Sound | A soundtrack with visuals locked to its pulses, or VO at full level + bed at −11 dB (0.28) + a wipe sound at −6 dB starting on the wipe's first frame + rings on the cut |
| Logo hold | 60–105f |

**Editorial variants of G** (measured on social launch films): *newsprint* — monochrome #f5f5f5 / #cdcfd2 / #38393d / #12161d with a halftone overlay, one warm accent (#ce9b29) on the product's main button only, heavy condensed grotesque for headlines and the hero number (the number may go to 200–260 px as the image), a small neutral sans for the narration line (≥ 40 px in a feed), B&W macro shots of 12–30f cut on the beat; *paper and daylight* — paper #f2f3ee / #d2d2cd, ink #1e191d, a static or barely drifting window-and-leaf shadow overlay at 10–18% multiply, small photos popping in 6f apart around a sentence built word by word, tiny red markers (#93282e) as the only accent, a count-up as the payoff.

**Goes wrong when**: texture is so heavy that text loses contrast, or glitch effects appear on every cut instead of as the signature.

## H. Music video

**What it is**: the music clock drives everything: tempo, first downbeat, beat, eighth and bar pulses, and a per-bar loudness table that drives intensity. Word-timed lyrics.

**Pick it when**: the user's track is the brief (lyric video, visualiser, music-led brand film).

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | Night violet #0b0620 / #150a33 with neon pink #ff3d9a, cyan #3df2ff and yellow #ffe14d; text #f4f1ff |
| Type | Grotesque for lyrics at 60–92 px; a second script for subtitles at 30–34 px, +0.08em |
| Motion | Beat pulse = exp(−fraction of beat × sharpness). Lines groove by pulse × 6 px. The sung word flashes accent pink, pops to 1.16 with a decaying wobble, fades to white. Impacts: FOV punch of −5 to −10°, camera shake decaying over 3–6f, a 2-frame colour-invert "impact frame" |
| Pacing | Lyric words about 7.5f apart; shots about 3.9 s; every scene starts on a bar line (at 132 BPM a beat is 13.6f, a bar 54.5f) |
| Transitions | Flash-to-white straddling every cut: ramp in over 4–8f (ease-in), cut, decay over 6–9f |
| Sound | The song at full level, nothing else. Video length equals track length |
| Logo hold | Through the track's last hit and tail |

**Goes wrong when**: cuts follow a beat grid on a track that has no steady beat (cut on phrases instead), or scenes start mid-bar.

## I. Brand guide / identity loop

**What it is**: the brand system as the content: mark, palette strip, type specimen, applications, lockup. Grids and rules are visible.

**Pick it when**: a brand reveal, a guidelines film, a looping identity piece for a site or event screen.

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | The brand's own hex values, shown on screen as content; the ground is the brand hex exactly (±2 levels at centre and corners), no vignette, no grain. Dotted rules (3 px every 16 px at about 16% opacity) |
| Type | The brand's display face at a measured cap height; labels 28–34 px, uppercase, +0.08em |
| Motion | Clip-draw the mark over 16f with a 26 px lift. Palette sheets slide 16f ease-out at staggers of 4–20f. Typewriter specimen with a colour trail 4 characters long. Slot-machine tiles (one face every 24f, an 11f roll, cells staggered 3f). Glitch text with a 2-frame stutter |
| Pacing | About 22f between beats; scenes 74–155f |
| Transitions | Ink panel wipe (8f), the last sheet keeps travelling and floods the frame (16f), the held word recedes on Z, photos morph into lockup blocks (18f) |
| Sound | One bed at full level, or a single quiet source boosted up to +6 dB |
| Logo hold | 19–150f; a loop holds the settled lockup for most of its length |

**Goes wrong when**: the mark is redrawn instead of using the real file (slightly wrong is worse than absent), or the specimen shows type the brand doesn't use. No logo file: set the name as a wordmark in the brand's face (`brand-sting` has the full no-logo policy).

## J. Milestone / stat

**What it is**: one big number tallies, lands with a punch, celebrates within two frames of landing, then breathes.

**Pick it when**: a count to celebrate (stars, users, revenue, a funding round).

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | Warm paper #FBFAF8 or #FAFAFA, ink #111114–#1C1917, muted #66666E (≥5.3:1 for small text), one brand orange like #FA5D19 |
| Type | Grotesque 500 at 250–264 px for the hero number (the image), −0.04 to −0.045em, tabular figures; caps labels 28 px at +0.2em |
| Motion | Hero number enters 12f (rise 50 px, blur 10, scale 0.94 → 1). Count 120–210f with ease-out cubic; any chart or bar draws on the **same** eased progress so the line and the digits settle together. Land punch 1 → 1.06 → 1 over 5f up and 13f down. Confetti or poppers fire within ±2f of the land. Afterwards the number breathes 0.4–1.5% |
| Pacing | Entrance inside 30f, the long count, a 90–120f payoff hold |
| Transitions | Usually a single scene; exit with a blur-out (12–16 px) |
| Sound | The catalog has none; add a soft tick per visible digit change (−9 dB or lower, thinned so it is not a buzz), a riser into the land and an impact on the land frame |
| Logo hold | The payoff hold is the lockup |

**Goes wrong when**: the count is linear (it should decelerate into the landing), or the celebration lands a few frames off the number.

## K. Social title-card launch

**What it is**: the short launch film of the feed: type cards of 2–4 words interleaved with product beats, on one ground that carries every cut. Real UI made cinematic (tilted, rim-lit, a control lifted to poster scale), glossy objects, light on edges. Measured on a curated set of social-native launch films.

**Pick it when**: a feature or product launch posted on X, LinkedIn or a feed under a message that carries the details; 8–30 s; 2–5 crisp facts.

| Signature | Numbers |
| --- | --- |
| Palette | Dark: near-black tinted toward the accent (#070b12, #0f0520, #09090b) with an edge or horizon glow in the accent (teal → lime #459a8e → #78d090, violet #6f3fb3 → #835ebc, blue #3a6b8d); or light: white with the accent rising from the bottom edge (#ffffff → #e7faed → #71e498), or one flat saturated field (#4c44f3). One accent word per card in a lighter tint of the accent |
| Type | One neutral grotesque, 500, sentence case. Full-frame cards: cap height 15–25% of the frame height in a feed or social cut (≈ 160–270 px at 1080 tall: the type fills the frame, not a small word on black); 72–110 px for captions and labels beside the product; −0.02em; two-tone captions (key words ink at 500, the rest muted at 400); one bleed word in the film at most (the product's own term, up to 40% of frame height). An inline glyph slot at cap height for a rebus line |
| Motion | Card words: glow-resolve or blurUp by word, 10–14f, stagger 3–4f; a punch word may smear in (scale x 1.5 → 1, blur 14 → 0, 8–10f). Card exit 6–8f with the ground's move. Product beats enter already moving; tilted UI pushes 1.0 → 1.25× over the beat; a lifted control springs to poster scale over 14–18f with no overshoot; objects pop 1.06 over 10f. A rotating gradient outline on the active control, one turn per 3–4 s |
| Pacing | A beat every 30–60f; cards held by the hold formula (33f for two words, 51f for four); product beats 45–90f; the peak beat 75–100f; URL card ≥ 60f. Scenes 30–100f |
| Transitions | Carried by the ground: a brand shape (arcs, a lens, a light band) closing and opening over 10–16f, the panel rising through the card while its words blur out, a defocus-through (blur 0 → 16 px over 6f, cut, 16 → 0 over 8f). Hard cuts only on the beat. One grammar for the film |
| Sound | A short track with a clear grid (110–128 BPM); cards' first legible frame on beats; product beats carry the effects (click on the press frame, pops and coin clusters on bursts, a hit when a swarm settles); the URL card on the button |
| Logo hold | 45–75f with the URL; the mark may appear earlier only docked beside the product |

**Goes wrong when**: title type shrinks to 3–5% of frame height on a big dark ground, the product beats show a whole dense dark screen, the cards are all clichés, or each cut uses a different wipe.

---

## Mixing families

- One family per film. A launch may open in A (three cards of kinetic type) before settling into B or C; say so in the Direction block and keep each passage pure.
- Never mix two palettes. If a second family's device is borrowed, it takes this film's palette.
- The owner skill's default family wins ties.

## Engine notes

- **Three.js** (the default engine): every family is buildable. Text is a canvas texture on a plane (`three-type`), UI is rebuilt as planes with canvas-drawn content, floods and wipes are planes parented to the camera, and the camera is a real camera (`three-camera`). Families C and D are native here. For B and E, use an orthographic camera or a perspective camera at a fixed distance so pixel sizes stay exact.
- **HyperFrames / React**: everything maps to DOM elements and transforms; keep the same numbers.

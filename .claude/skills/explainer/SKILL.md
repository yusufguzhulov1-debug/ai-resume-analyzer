# Explainer

An explainer answers one question the viewer actually has. Everything in it either moves the viewer toward that answer or gets cut. The craft is mostly restraint: one idea per scene, each piece of the diagram arriving when the voice names it, the same objects recurring until the answer is obvious. Frames at 30 fps. Read `direction` first; moves come from `motion-language`, the mix from `sound-design`.

> **These are references, not rules.** The numbers, beat sheets, style families and examples here are starting points distilled from work that landed well, not a recipe to fill in. The user's instructions always win over anything in this skill. When a different idea serves the brief better, propose it and try it: change the structure, break a default, invent a device, and write what you changed and why in `VIDEO.md`. What stays fixed is correctness: determinism, legibility and safe zones, loudness and clipping, licences and credits, never putting words in a real person's mouth, and the sound bans in `sound-design` (no whoosh; never a synthesised noise bed, room tone or "air", which reads as wind or hiss on phones). The checks at the end are a quality bar to clear, not a template to reproduce.

## When to use

- "Explain how our sync engine works", "how vaccines work", "types of databases in 60 seconds", "visualise this data", "break down this process step by step", "why X matters".
- A technical concept for developers, a process for customers, a report's findings for a general audience.

Another owner fits better when:

| The ask is really | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Selling or launching a product | `launch-playbook` |
| A walkthrough of the product's own UI, one workflow | `demo-walkthrough` |
| One number to celebrate | `announce-milestone` |
| A shipped feature | `announce-feature` |
| A talking-head recording to cut and caption | `video-editing` |

## Ask first

1. **What question should the viewer be able to answer afterwards?** Their words, one line. Offer your best guess.
2. **Narrated, or on-screen text only?** It changes the length (text-led runs about 1.5× longer per idea) and the whole build order.
3. **Who is it for, and what do they already know?** A developer can see code and an architecture; a buyer needs the outcome first.

## Step 1: the question, the answer, the spine

- Write the **question** in one line, then the **answer** in one sentence (the thesis). The video is the long version of that sentence; the last scene restates it.
- Write the **spine**: 3–6 ideas, each one sentence, in the order the viewer needs them, not the order the source material uses. If the source is a doc or a URL, extract its ideas and reorder them; never follow its paragraphs.
- **Facts**: from the user's material or `web-research`, with the source noted in `VIDEO.md` for every number. Say so when you only have what the user gave.
- **Accuracy**: every explainer simplifies; write each simplification in `VIDEO.md` with the misconception it could plant ("a replica drawn as updating instantly though it lags by seconds: harmless, said once"; "calling a hash 'encryption': plants a wrong model, reworded"). Reword any on-screen line a domain expert would correct, and show the threat a safeguard stops before the safeguard (a forged request before the token check, a germ before the antibody), or the safeguard answers nothing. Then answer the question an expert asks next ("why can't the attacker just pass it along?"): show **what** the safeguard checks, not only that it exists. The test: an expert reading the on-screen lines **and the diagram's states** (what passes, what succeeds, what fails, what changes colour) finds nothing to correct; a ✓ shown while the attack is still in place is a wrong picture even under a right line.

## Step 2: pick the shape

| Shape | Structure | Example | Peak |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **How it works** | Setup → mechanism in 3–5 steps → result | How a request travels through a CDN | The step where it clicks |
| **Why it matters** | Problem → cost of ignoring it → the idea → what changes | Why your team needs observability | The cost made visible |
| **This vs that** | Two options → the 2–3 axes that matter → verdict per situation | SQL vs document databases | The verdict |
| **By the numbers** | A surprising number → what drives it → what it means | How much water a data centre uses | The hero number |
| **Listicle** | N items, the same template each, a reason to watch to the end | Six types of databases | The last or best item |
| **Story** | A person or a packet with a goal → obstacles → resolution, teaching along the way | The life of an email | The resolution |

Pick one. Mixing shapes is how a 60-second explainer becomes three minutes.

## Direction defaults

- **Style family**: F (whiteboard explainer) for concepts with VO; B (soft-light SaaS) when the subject is a product's own flow; J for a by-the-numbers piece; G (textured tactile) for a technical audience that wants attitude; C when the concept is physical (hardware, money, objects). **Text-led concept** (no VO): G's dark HUD variant for developers, or F's look on a dark ground (strokes #ededef on #0b0b0c) for a general audience; F's whiteboard timings are VO-timed, so use the text-led clock in Step 4 instead. The family gives the look only: this skill's pacing and scene lengths win over the family's (G's 25–30f beat rate is not an explainer's).
- **Colour**: one brand accent for emphasis, plus at most **one semantic state colour** (a threat or error red for the attacker, the failure, the warning) when the topic has a villain. It is always paired with a shape or a label (✗, "impostor", "lost") so it reads without colour, and never colours a message line.
- **Energy curve**: a low plateau in steps: question/problem (4) → solution idea (7) → steps (5–6, steady) → **payoff (8) at 75–90%** → answer restated (5). No hype peaks, but **the click is the film's biggest scale change**: on the click frame, push into the device or bring its parts to hero size (≥ 15% of the frame's height), and change the layout, not only a colour. A 40 px icon swapping for another 40 px icon is not a click.
- **Pacing**: Calm (a new idea every 45–70f; diagram parts 4–12f apart within it); scenes 200–300f (about 7–10 s) with VO, 150–210f text-led. A change inside the frame every 1–2 s, driven by the VO, or by the lines when there is none (Step 4).
- **Transitions**: F uses the **board erase** as signature and workhorse; B uses the persisting element (the recurring object carries across every cut) with exit-then-cut between chapters. One direction of travel for the process (left to right).
- **Camera on a persisting diagram**: a diagram that persists across scenes is **reframed every scene**: push in over 24–48f, rest to rest (`three-camera`), so the part the headline names is the largest thing on screen, and pull back to the whole only for the payoff (then push into the payoff device). "Persist" means the same objects, not the same shot: five scenes in one wide shot with a thin strip of diagram is a Frame fault (layouts vary by job).
- **Hook**: YouTube and feeds alike, frame 0 is in motion and the tension is on screen by 1 s (30f): the question, the surprising number, or **the danger happening** (the failure the film explains, already under way at frame 0). The first frame is never an empty diagram. Hook patterns: `references/devices.md` §4.
- **Sound**: VO-led. VO at 1.0, a bed of 90–110 BPM, sparse, no lead melody, at the level in `sound-design`'s bed row (0.1–0.2 under any voice, default 0.18 ≈ −15 dB); light UI or pen sounds at most one per 2–3 s; the music's button under the final answer. **Text-led**: music-led at 1.0 (sparse, no lead melody), its dropout on the breath and its return on the payoff, plus a sparse cue on the moments the film hinges on (`sound-design`'s text-led recipe).
- **Memorable moment**: the payoff device: the recurring packet finally arrives, the two options separate on the axis that matters, the diagram completes and the takeaway underlines itself.

## Step 3: one idea per scene

Every scene has: a **headline** of 2–6 words that states the idea, one **visual device** that makes it visible, and one **takeaway** line or mark. Name the clarity device in the beat table:

| Device | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| Analogy (we show X as Y) | The mechanism is invisible: encryption as a locked box, latency as a road |
| Progressive disclosure | A diagram with 4+ parts: build it part by part, on the VO |
| Before / after | The point is a change: same framing, two states |
| Worked example | A rule is abstract: run one real input through it |
| Zoom (part ↔ whole) | Where something sits in a system: push into the part, pull back to the whole |
| Rule of three | A list: three items, the third the twist |
| Side by side | A comparison: both options move on the same beat on the same axis |

**Recurring objects** make it one story: the packet in scene 2 is the packet encrypted in scene 3 and delivered in scene 5. Keep its shape, colour and size constant (one module both scenes import). When it changes state (plain → sealed → delivered), every state gets its own look, and the state a muted viewer must not misread is labelled: a plaintext pill reappearing at the payoff reads as "still exposed" unless it is shown opened inside its destination and tagged.

`references/devices.md` has visual metaphors for common technical concepts and the data-viz rules. Read it when a scene has a chart, a number or an abstract system.

## Step 4: words

- **Narrated**: write the VO first, generate it, then time the picture to it. 2.3 words/s by default (2.5 ceiling, 2.0 for a calm premium read). Budgets after the lead-in and a VO-free tail: 30 s ≤64 words, 60 s ≤134, 90 s ≤200, 180 s ≤400.
- **VO placement**: VO starts **6f after every cut** (the house explainer does exactly this, 8 of 8 cuts) so the eye lands before the ear; a line that bridges a cut may start up to 45f early.
- **Reveal on the cue**: each part of the diagram appears on the frame its noun is spoken (±3f), not all in the first quarter of the scene. Get word times with `transcribe` on the generated VO; without it, estimate at 13 frames per word from the line's start.
- Write VO as cues ("First the request — then the cache — then the answer"). Write numbers as spoken; show the exact figure.
- **Text-led** (no VO): the on-screen lines carry the argument and **are the clock**. ≤12 words of message lines at once (headlines and the line being read; the diagram's labels are capped separately: ≤5 labelled parts, each label on its part), held `max(30, 9 × words + 15)` frames from legible **and never faster than 15 characters per second** (≥ 2 frames per character: a 5-word, 34-character line needs 68f, not 60), one idea per line; every number shown and held ≥30f after it lands.
  - Each diagram part appears within 6f of the on-screen word that names it, counted **from the frame that word starts entering** (the line types or rises; the part arrives on its noun).
  - **A part that moves to make the point is ≥ 8% of the frame's height** (≥ 86 px at 1080): a 60 px chip crossing a 1920 px wire is texture, not a beat, on a phone or on the meter. Entrances by role: nodes draw on, things that travel leave a lit trail, keys and seals stamp, threats cut in hard.
  - A scene ends ≤30f after its last line's hold is met. Scene length ≈ the sum of its lines' holds + the device's animation + about 20f.
  - A line held over 2× its formula needs something in the device to change during it (a packet crossing, a readout updating); otherwise the scene is too long. Static stretches over 2.5 s are a Fix in `direction`'s critique.
- Silence is allowed: a 15–30f pause in the VO while a diagram completes lets it be read.
- **The breath before the payoff is 10–30f of picture**, even when the music's dropout under it runs longer: keep the last line or the held diagram on screen through the rest of the dropout; a 2 s frame with no line and only a small part moving reads as a stall.

## The whiteboard scene grammar (family F)

Measured from the house explainer, scene-local frames, scenes 200–240f:

| Frames | Element | Motion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–2 | Tag and number ("03") | Draw on 10–12f |
| 6 | Title (2–6 words, 96–112 px) | Text draws along its strokes over clamp(width / 45, 8, 18) frames, outCubic; rises 6 px |
| 16 | Subtitle (48 px, grey) | Same draw |
| 24–60 | Diagram strokes | 8–20f each, 4–12f apart, on the VO's nouns; dots overshoot 35% while drawing |
| 76–124 | Takeaway and examples | Examples 5f apart; a red underline draws 12f after its phrase |
| end − 18 → end − 8 | **Board erase** | Every element reverses its stroke over 10f inOutCubic |
| last 8f | Blank paper | Then cut onto identical paper; VO +6f |

Hold: text floats ±1.2 px; camera drift x ±4 px, y ±2.5 px with a +1.2% mid-scene zoom, built from `sin(2πp)` so it **returns to rest at both ends** and every cut lands on identical paper. Single left column at a 140 px margin; palette paper #fff, ink #1e1e1e, grey #495057, one red #e03131 for emphasis only.

## Beat sheets

Payoff at 75–90%. Each step scene is one idea from the spine. Text-led films fit fewer ideas in the same length (a line is read slower than it is heard): use the Text-led column.

| Length | Beats (frames) | Scenes | VO | Text-led |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **30 s** (900f) | Question 0–120 · step 1 120–310 · step 2 310–500 · step 3 500–690 · **payoff 690–810** · answer 810–900 | 5–6 | ≤64 | Question 0–120 · 2 steps of 170–200f · payoff · answer; 4–5 scenes, ≤ 2 lines each |
| **45 s** (1350f) | Question 0–150 · idea 150–360 · steps 360–1020 (3 scenes of 220f) · **payoff 1020–1200** (peak ≈ 1050, 78%) · answer 1200–1350 | 6–7 | ≤98 | Question 0–180 · 3 steps of 180–210f (180–780) · turn 780–990 · **payoff 990–1200** (peak ≈ 1020, 76%) · answer 1200–1350 held ≥ 60f; 6 scenes, ≤ 2 lines each (text-led: scenes ≈ length ÷ 7 s) |
| **60 s** (1800f) | Question/problem 0–210 · idea 210–420 · steps 420–1350 (3–4 scenes of 230–300f) · **payoff 1350–1590** · answer + end card 1590–1800 | 6–8 | ≤134 | 3–4 steps of 150–210f; 6–7 scenes |
| **90 s** (2700f) | Question 0–240 · idea 240–480 · steps 480–2040 (5–6 scenes) · **payoff 2040–2400** · answer 2400–2700 | 8–10 | ≤200 | 5 steps; 8–9 scenes |
| **180 s** (5400f) | Question 0–300 · 3 chapters of 3–4 scenes each (a 45–75f chapter card between them) · **payoff ~4500** · answer 5100–5400 | 12–16 | ≤400 | Rarely works text-led past 90 s: ask for VO |

Listicle: every item gets the same template and the same frame budget (±10%), numbered in the corner; a 9:16 listicle item is 90–150f. The end restates the answer from Step 1 and holds it ≥60f; never a summary slide of bullets.

## Building it

- **Three.js (default)**: the fitted stage from `three-camera` (pixel-exact at z = 0, which the type kit, line art and cover layers assume; pushes into a part and drift that returns to rest come from the same rig); text as canvas-texture planes that reveal left to right with a mask (`three-type`); strokes as lines or ribbon meshes whose draw range grows along the path; the board erase is the same draw range reversed; recurring objects as one shared mesh factory (`three-assets`); the look from `three-look`; scene handoffs from `three-transitions`.
- **HyperFrames**: one sub-composition per scene; SVG strokes drawn by dash offset on the timeline; VO as `<audio>` elements starting 0.2 s after each slot.
- **React**: `@genmotion/motion` `<TextAnimation>` for headlines, SVG `strokeDashoffset` driven by `interpolate` for strokes.

## Good and bad

- Bad: scene 1 shows the whole architecture diagram with six labelled boxes while the VO introduces the first one. Good: the client box draws as "your app" is said, the arrow draws on "sends a request", the cache appears on "cache".
- Bad: six scenes, six different visual styles. Good: one packet, one palette, one left column, the board erasing between ideas.
- Bad: a pie chart with a legend and seven slices. Good: one bar that grows next to one other bar, both labelled directly.

## Requirements

| Need | What | Fallback when it is missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facts | `web-research` | Use only what the user gave you, and say so |
| Narration | `pick-voice`, then `voiceover` | Text-led: on-screen lines carry the argument |
| Word timings for reveals | `transcribe` | Estimate 13 frames per word from the line's start |
| Bed and button | `music` | No track supplied → source one per `sound-design` Music and fit the beat table to its grid with `sound-design`'s `references/beat-sync.md`; VO alone, every line ending on its own decay; text-led with nothing sourceable: sparse synthesised cues (`sound-design`) and say so |
| Pen, click sounds | `sfx` | None; VO carries it |
| Seeing it | `capture-frames` | None |
| Loudness | `ffmpeg` | None |
| Direction, moves, mix | `direction`, `motion-language`, `sound-design` | — |

## Checks before you finish

1. `VIDEO.md` holds the question, the one-sentence answer and the spine; the last scene states the answer and holds it ≥60f.
2. Every scene's headline is 2–6 words; no scene is a bulleted list; every scene's device is named in the beat table.
3. `capture-frames` mid-way through every scene, muted: the device reads without the narration.
4. Reveal on cue: for three diagram parts, the frame the part appears is within ±3f of its spoken noun (word times from `transcribe`), or, text-led, within 6f of the frame the on-screen word that names it starts entering. On the click frame, the device's parts are ≥ 15% of the frame's height or the camera has pushed in. Every part that moves to make a point measures ≥ 8% of the frame's height. A persisting diagram is framed differently in each scene (compare the scenes' middle frames: the named part is the largest thing in each).
5. VO starts 6f (3–8f) after every cut; VO words ≤ the budget; no line runs past its scene unless it deliberately bridges. Text-led: every message line meets the hold formula and ≤ 15 characters per second; no scene runs more than 30f past its last line's hold; every range the `freezedetect` pass in `direction`'s critique flags over 2.5 s is confirmed on a crop or, with camera drift, on a 4 fps strip (critique §1) before it is cleared, and genuinely still stretches of 1.5 s or more get a visible move.
6. Frame 0 is in motion and the tension is on screen by 1 s.
7. Family F: capture the last frame of a scene and the first of the next: both are blank paper, pixel-identical (drift at rest).
8. Every number on screen holds ≥30f after it lands and has a source line in `VIDEO.md`. `VIDEO.md` lists the simplifications and the misconception each could plant; reading only the on-screen lines, a domain expert would correct nothing.
9. The bed sits at `sound-design`'s bed row under VO (0.1–0.2, 14–20 LU under the voice); `ebur128` gives −14 LUFS ±1 and true peak ≤ −1 dBTP.
10. The `direction` self-critique passes (the swap test: another company's explainer could not use these frames); `validate` passes.
